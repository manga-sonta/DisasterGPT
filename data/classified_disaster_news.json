        "content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAs California recovers from devastating wildfires and hurricane season fast approaches, President Donald Trump and the White House DOGE team are slashing the workforce at the federal agency responsible for monitoring extreme weather.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to more than a dozen current and former employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who said that staff and policy changes were making their day-to-day jobs more challenging. They worried about how the upheaval would affect Americans' safety — especially as hurricane and tornado seasons rapidly approach.\n\nAndrew Hazelton, a former NOAA hurricane modeler who was fired in February alongside other probationary employees, was blunt: If forecasts and hurricane warnings go downhill, he told BI, \"we could see loss of life as a result.\"\n\nThe agency's reach extends across the country and the globe. Besides its work on extreme climate conditions, NOAA provides the data that powers the weather app on your phone, alerts pilots to turbulence, and helps farmers know when to plant to keep American agriculture rolling.\n\n\"It really, truly affects every single American every day,\" a former probationary employee said. (Some employees we spoke to asked to remain anonymous.)\n\nBefore Trump took office in January, NOAA employed around 12,430 people, according to a congressional report. More than 1,000 employees have departed through layoffs or buyouts, said JoAnn Becker, the president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization, a union representing NOAA employees. More than 600 were terminated in February and about 500 took the administration's buyout offer, according to previous reporting.\n\nBetween the uncertain future for probationary employees, voluntary early retirements and buyouts, and Trump's ongoing government-wide reduction-in-force effort, the agency may shrink further.\n\n\"We would like to just go on and do our jobs and save people's lives,\" an employee at the National Weather Service, a department within NOAA, said.\n\nOutside of staffing cuts, some employees said stricter rules around travel and expense budgets have made it difficult to do the jobs that are vital to protecting people from natural disasters. Expiration dates for contracts marked as \"urgent\" are also coming up soon, according to internal documents viewed by BI.\n\nAn \"extensive process was conducted to ensure that mission-critical functions to fulfill NOAA's statutory responsibilities weren't compromised,\" a Trump administration spokesperson told BI in a statement. The spokesperson declined to provide additional details about the process.\n\nSusan Buchanan, a NOAA spokeswoman, said that the agency remains dedicated to its mission. A spokesperson for the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA, did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\n\nFor those who remain, the show must go on, even as resources and staff dwindle.\n\n\"We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people,\" a NOAA employee said. \"Eventually one of them is probably going to fall.\"\n\nAviation at risk\n\nSeveral people who spoke to BI expressed unease over how the staffing cuts and operational changes at NOAA could affect the aviation industry.\n\nThough flying remains the safest mode of transportation, a National Weather Service employee who's worked at the agency for more than a decade said that if the turmoil at the agency continues long term, \"I don't know if I'd trust getting on a plane.\"\n\nNOAA assists with running aviation-specific weather models for pilots, helping them track things like turbulence. Its data \"ripples right through the whole system,\" Brad Colman, the former president of the American Meteorological Society, said.\n\n\"If systems are degraded, a turbulence forecast may go down in quality, and uncertainty is increased,\" Colman said. \"There's more exposure, more risk.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Airline Dispatchers Federation told BI in an email that NOAA provides dispatchers with \"essential tools,\" including turbulence, wind, and weather forecasts.\n\n\"Virtually all\" of the weather data for domestic flights comes from NOAA, and its data is \"fundamental\" to daily operations, the spokesperson said. The organization hasn't yet noticed operational impacts but warned that \"even subtle degradations could affect our operations.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeteorologists who work for airlines receive foundational data from NOAA to develop their forecasts, the spokesperson added, noting that smaller airlines will likely face more challenges if NOAA's data degrades — potentially creating a disparity in safety across the industry.\n\nOr as Tom Di Liberto, a former public affairs official and climate scientist who was fired in February, put it: \"There's a reason why a lot of weather forecast offices are close by or at a major airport.\"\n\nLess reliable forecasts\n\nStaffers affected by the terminations weren't just at NOAA's headquarters in Maryland; they were stationed in regional offices across the country.\n\nOne office in Alaska stopped launching daily weather balloons to collect data for forecasts, Larry Hubble, an upper air program manager in the state, said. On March 20, the National Weather Service temporarily suspended weather balloon launches at offices in Nebraska and South Dakota, while seven other sites are scaling back to one launch a day instead of two because of staffing shortages.\n\nOther instruments, like radars on commercial aircraft and satellites, also collect data. The NWS employee of more than a decade said that balloons are one of the most accurate methods of weather measurement, and if they're scaled back, \"they're going to start seeing the degradation of the models and the forecast is going to lose its accuracy.\"\n\n\"If you degrade our capabilities, our warnings get weaker and people and property get compromised,\" a NOAA employee told BI. \"Damages are going to increase, people are not going to get out of harm's way, and they're going to die.\"\n\nThe Government and Accountability Office said in a March report that staffing shortages and aircraft maintenance problems in recent years had already hampered hurricane hunters' ability to perform their jobs — well before DOGE ever came knocking on doors.\n\nThe private sector depends on NOAA\n\nThe changes at NOAA will likely ripple across the private sector, affecting a range of industries, some employees told BI. The reinsurance industry, for example, uses NOAA data to help confirm damages from natural disasters and dole out funds. Construction workers rely on NOAA data to figure out where to build new projects.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nThe economic implications are vast — NOAA's products impact more than one-third of the country's GDP, according to the agency's website.\n\n\"If you take out NOAA, the private sector cannot do what NOAA does,\" Di Liberto said. The agency operates thousands of weather balloons, hundreds of buoys, 10 airplanes, and 18 satellites and makes that information accessible to the entire public — not just those who can pay for it.\n\nThe spokesperson from the Airline Dispatchers Federation said that private weather companies provide helpful supplemental services, but they ultimately rely on NOAA's raw data.\n\n\"There is simply no replacement for NOAA's comprehensive data collection infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Juliana Kaplan.\n\nHave a tip?

The large outflows move through material, creating shock waves in space that heat the material; as the material cools, it produces light—revealing objects like the glowing orange outflow above.\n\nHH 49/50 was dubbed the Cosmic Tornado in 2006, when it was discovered by scientists using NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope. Webb has better resolution than Spitzer, giving scientists a more precise view of the outflow’s features. Furthermore, the object at the tip of the outflow—seen by Spitzer as a blue splotch—is now clearly visible, allowing scientists to identify it as a spiral galaxy.\n\nWebb’s image of HH 49/50 made use of the telescope’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCAM) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to reveal the distribution of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and energized dust grains in the outflow. The data will eventually help scientists model the jet’s properties, as well as how it affects surrounding material.\n\nScientists believe that a protostar named Cederblad 110 IRS4, located about 1.5 light-years from HH 49/50, may drive the jets that are energizing the material in the object.\n\nThe galaxy seen at the tip of HH 49/50 is much more distant; eventually, HH 49/50 will appear to cover up the galaxy, though according to an ESA release that overlap will take thousands of years.\n\nOther Herbig-Haro objects are worth noting. Consider HH 46/47, which looks just like a question mark floating in space. HH 49/50 isn’t even the Webb Space Telescope’s first foray into the objects; in 2023, the telescope captured the very elongated jets of HH 211, about 1,000 light-years from Earth."

        "content": "Dry conditions, wind and trees downed by Hurricane Helene fueled wildfires in North Carolina and South Carolina, where evacuation orders were in effect Tuesday. Many people in the area are still getting over the hurricane that hit in September, according to North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Bo Dossett. “A lot of the damage and the blowdown, the downed trees from Hurricane Helene are contributing to the difficulties that our firefighters are facing trying to contain this fire and so that has just been kind of one ongoing crisis from September all through into the spring for a lot of these residents,” Dossett said. “This is one more thing that they’re having to deal with on top of what they experienced back in the fall.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for parts of the South Carolina Upstate, western North Carolina and northeast Georgia through Tuesday night, as conditions were expected to be favorable for the rapid spread of wildfire with lingering dry air and winds picking up to 10 to 20 mph (16 to 32 kph) and gusting 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph). Mandatory evacuations were in effect for 146 properties in rural Polk County on Tuesday, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte, North Carolina, according to county spokesperson Kellie Cannon. Three fires there have burned at least 9.6 square miles (25 square kilometers) in that county and in neighboring Henderson County as of Tuesday, and the two larger fires are uncontained, according to the forest service. Officials released maps Tuesday that show evacuation zones in the two counties. The Black Cove Fire is one of the larger blazes. Officials said a downed power line sparked that fire, but the causes of the other two fires are under investigation.\n\nHenderson County has issued voluntary evacuation orders and opened an emergency shelter. Volunteer fire departments were on standby, Henderson County spokesperson Mike Morgan told WLOS-TV. “Especially near some of the homes where if the fire did jump, we can be there to help protect those homes,” Morgan said. “We’re here to monitor the situation very closely.” Two fires were burning in the mountains of South Carolina. The fires in Table Rock State Park and nearby Persimmon Ridge have burned a combined 2.3 square miles (5.9 square kilometers), the South Carolina Forestry Commission said. Officials said both fires were ignited by human activity and neither were contained as of Monday night. No injuries were reported, and no structures were imminently threatened as of Monday night, but voluntary evacuations were issued for about 100 homes over the weekend. On Tuesday morning, the forestry commission updated an earlier announcement to say no evacuations were planned near the Persimmon Ridge Fire, but residents were urged to be prepared to leave their homes if an evacuation is suggested in the future.\n\n“The weather over the next few days remains concerning, as relative humidities are expected to remain very low, and the forecasted wind speeds will still be conducive to spreading the fire,” the forestry commission said.\n\nDry weather and millions of trees knocked down by Hurricane Helene last year are creating a long and active fire season in the Carolinas, according to North Carolina State University forestry and environmental resources professor Robert Scheller. Scheller predicted this busy fire season if the region saw dry weather after the hurricane.\n\n“Helene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,” Scheller said. “Then these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.”\n\nDespite recent rain, most of the Carolinas are abnormally dry or experiencing a moderate drought, according to federal monitors."

Made up of 15 UK aid agencies, including the British Red Cross, Oxfam and Save the Children, the DEC is asking the British public for donations before the monsoon season arrives in two months. More than 2,800 people have died and more than 4,500 have been injured, according to the leaders of Myanmar's military government, with figures expected to rise. The charities say shelter, medicine, food, water and cash support is \"urgently needed\".\n\nBaroness Chapman, minister for development, said public donations to the DEC appeal would be matched pound-for-pound by the government, up to the value of £5m. DEC's chief executive Saleh Saeed said the situation was \"ever more critical.\" \"Funds are urgently needed to help families access life-saving humanitarian aid following this catastrophe,\" he said. Multiple international aid agencies and foreign governments have dispatched personnel and supplies to quake-hit regions.\n\nMyanmar was already facing a severe humanitarian crisis before the 7.7 magnitude earthquake due to the ongoing civil war there, with the DEC estimating a third of the population is in need of aid. The country has been gripped by violence amid the conflict between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country. On Wednesday, Myanmar's military government announced a temporary ceasefire lasting until 22 April, saying it was aimed at expediting relief and reconstruction efforts. Rebel groups had already unilaterally declared a ceasefire to support relief efforts earlier this week, but the military had refused to do the same until Wednesday's announcement. Aid workers have come under attack in Myanmar. On Tuesday night, the army opened fire at a Chinese Red Cross convoy carrying earthquake relief supplies. Nine of the charity's vehicles came under attack. The UN and some charities have accused the military junta of blocking access.\n\nReuters Aid is being sent from across the globe to help disaster-stricken communities\n\nArete/DEC Mandalay city was near the epicentre of the magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck on Friday"

        "content": "A report published this week by the National Hurricane Center revealed the brutal impact of Hurricane Helene, which hit the American Southeast in late September 2024. The center reports that Hurricane Helene was the deadliest storm since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nThe report found that Helene “is responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States (including at least 175 direct deaths),” making it the deadliest storm in 20 years. You can read the NHC’s comprehensive report here.\n\nHurricane preparedness is critical in minimizing loss of property and life. Whether it’s boarding up windows, sandbagging homes, or simply up and leaving, getting early warnings of extreme weather is critical to mitigating damage from those storms.\n\nIn Helene’s case, flash flooding (as the name suggests) happened quite suddenly, and far inland, catching many by surprise. Direct fatalities occur due to a storm’s immediate impacts—whether it be flooding, rip currents, landslides, or falling trees. Ninety-four people died from Helene’s flooding and the resulting landslides, according to the report, with the second deadliest culprit being wind, which caused 65 direct deaths.\n\nCurrently, about 10% of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration staff are either laid off or not allowed to work due to Trump administration-driven cuts whose legality is now being determined by the courts; last week, Gizmodo spoke with a meteorologist and hurricane hunter who flew through several storms, including Helene, about the situation.\n\nWhen Helene made landfall as a Category 4 storm, it knocked out power for millions of people across the American southeast and caused flooding as far inland as Tennessee and western North Carolina. The storm plunged swathes of Georgia and the Carolinas into darkness, captured in eerie satellite images.\n\nHelene’s impacts weren’t just felt on the ground. The International Space Station’s Atmospheric Waves Experiment (AWE) captured images of gravity waves in Earth’s atmosphere, churned up by the intense storm.\n\n2024’s hurricanes were strong and unpredictable across the board; consider Hurricane Milton, which swelled from a Category 1 storm to a Category 5 event in just seven hours. The Atlantic hurricanes last season took advantage of especially moist conditions—breeding ground for intense storms.\n\nHelene’s death toll is dwarfed by that of Hurricane Katrina, which reportedly caused nearly 1,400 deaths, including 520 direct deaths. Many of the 565 indirect fatalities (318) were cardiovascular in nature, and 307 additional fatalities could not be definitively labeled as either directly or indirectly caused by Katrina.\n\nHurricane season doesn’t start back up until June 30, and will run through November 30. Here’s hoping that NOAA can sort out its staffing issues before the worst comes to pass."

        "content": "Maple syrup, often called Canada’s “liquid gold,” has long been a target for fraudulent activities, such as the dilution or substitution with other syrups, due to its high demand.\n\nAmid threats from the United States of increased tariffs and the imposition of a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports that aren’t compliant with the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, increased maple syrup fraud is a possibility.\n\nFood fraud, or economically motivated adulteration, is the deliberate misrepresentation of food for economic gain. This can include the substitution, dilution, addition and/or the removal of ingredients. Mislabelling of products is another form of food fraud that can happen at any point in the supply chain, from farm to fork. Food fraud is a multi-billion-dollar industry and poses serious risks. It can harm consumer health, tarnish brand reputations and value, jeopardize the livelihood of legitimate producers and even hamper biodiversity and conservational efforts.\n\nThe threats of tariffs on Canadian goods by the U.S., which includes maple syrup and equipment used to make it, has raised concerns on both sides of the border about price increases and supply shortages. Canada produces more than 70% of the world’s maple syrup and Québec is the capital of this production. In 2024, the province exported around $450 million worth of maple syrup to the U.S.\n\nHistoric increases in food fraud\n\nHistorically, food fraud has increased during harsh economic times, growing financial pressures, pandemics, climate incidents, wars, supply chain disruptions or any other event that destabilizes the balance between food supply and demand. These circumstances often increase food prices, creating an incentive for fraudsters to exploit the system.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2024, the world faced significant supply chain disruptions due to the covid-19 pandemic, regional wars and significant climate events. Unsurprisingly, food fraud cases have increased tenfold, according to recent estimations. Threats of higher tariffs could further contribute to this problem by increasing the likelihood that fraudsters will substitute high-value foods for lower-value products.\n\nGiven what we have learned from past cases of food fraud, threats of increased tariffs causes uncertainty in the supply chain, increasing the risk of fraudulent maple syrups from entering the market. To combat this threat, there is a need for rapid, real-time and cost-effective methods to test maple syrup for authenticity.\n\nMethods for testing maple syrup\n\nSince the 1980s, various methods and tools have been developed or used to detect maple syrup adulteration. However, food fraudsters continuously adapt to evade detection, making it progressively more difficult to test for maple syrup adulteration. The more complex the testing methods, the more difficult they are to circumvent.\n\nTraditionally, maple syrup quality testing involves measuring the dissolved sugar content in syrup through a unit of measurement known as degrees Brix. One degree Brix is equivalent to 1% sugar. However, applications may be limited if unknown or non-conventional adulterants are used.\n\nAs fraud techniques become more sophisticated, new approaches are needed to ensure the authenticity of maple syrup. Non-targeted food analytical methods, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, allow for the screening of a wide range of samples, creating a fingerprint of a sample. The fingerprints can be compared to a reference library of profiles, or multiple attributes specific to maple syrups, rather than just one.\n\nTesting maple syrup for glowing compounds\n\nA recent study by our research team at the University of Guelph’s Corradini Lab explored how fluorescence fingerprints can be used to detect maple syrup adulteration. Fluorescence fingerprinting works by examining how internal molecules in maple syrup glow when exposed to UV and visible light. These unique, glowing fingerprints allow for the detection of markers or features that may be indicative of maple syrup fraud.\n\nOur study explored the adulteration of amber and dark maple syrups, with common maple syrup adulterants—namely beet, corn and rice syrups—at values ranging from one to 50%.\n\nWe mapped unique and distinctive features in the fluorescence fingerprints, which were then used for differentiating pure from adulterated syrups. When exposed to UV and visible light, maple syrup features changed depending on the type—beet, corn or rice syrups—and amount of adulterant.\n\nAI and machine learning for improved detection\n\nUsing the markers of maple syrup identity, we were able to apply AI to analyze multiple fluorescent features simultaneously. This allowed for the identification of pure maple syrups from adulterants, with accuracy ranging from 75 to 99%.\n\nIn fact, analyzing the fluorescence fingerprints of pure and adulterated syrups with the assistance of AI and machine learning techniques improved detection by up to 30%, and identified adulterants at levels less than two per cent.\n\nHowever, expanding the fluorescence fingerprint reference library can improve the accuracy and reliability of results. AI models often require very large and extensive databases. This will be crucial for understanding and accounting for how factors like the environment, geographic location and processing conditions may affect the maple syrup glow. The use of AI to analyze fluorescent markers in maple syrup could allow for rapid and effective identification of suspicious fraudulent samples.\n\nWith the increased risk of food fraud due to threats of increased U.S. import tariffs on Canadian products, combining AI and maple syrup fingerprinting can detect maple syrup fraud. This will ensure that consumers receive safe, high-quality foods while protecting the identity of one of Canada’s most iconic products.\n\nMaleeka Singh, PhD Candidate, Food Science, University of Guelph; Maria G.

        "content": "'Beauty from the ashes.' Texas Panhandle recovering one year after the state's largest wildfire\n\ntoggle caption Rachel Osier Lindley/The Texas Newsroom\n\nCANADIAN, TEXAS — As the longtime editor and publisher of The Canadian Record, Laurie Ezzell Brown had covered many wildfires in the drought-plagued Texas Panhandle. But nothing prepared her for what she saw after the Smokehouse Creek Fire last year.\n\n\"Everyone I know lost something,\" Ezzell Brown told The Texas Newsroom, as she stood surrounded by the newspaper's archives at its office downtown. The fire, she said, \"had moved so quickly and done so much damage in so little time, it was shocking to see.\"\n\nThe amount of earth it scorched, the high winds and how the fire jumped from place to place made this fire different, she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The firefighters that I talked to said they'd never seen anything like it,\" Ezzell Brown remembered.\n\nThe Smokehouse Creek Fire would eventually become the largest wildfire in Texas history, burning over a million acres. Two people were killed and hundreds of structures were destroyed, including 53 houses in Canadian. The fire started in late February and burned through mid-March.\n\nA year later, residents of Canadian and the surrounding ranchlands are still picking up the pieces of their lives. They say a full recovery could take years.\n\ntoggle caption Rachel Osier Lindley/The Texas Newsroom\n\nA firsthand look at Smokehouse Creek fire recovery\n\nEzzell Brown has lived most of her life in Canadian. While The Canadian Record stopped publishing a print edition in 2023, Ezzell Brown still maintains the newspaper's website and social media. In the fire's immediate aftermath, she straddled the line between journalist and neighbor — documenting the losses of her friends and loved ones.\n\n\"I started going out and seeing what had burned and then talking to the homeowners who were picking up, you know, whatever remained of their lives,\" Ezzell Brown said. \"And there wasn't much left.\"\n\nWith a population of about 2,200, Canadian is one of dozens of idyllic-looking small towns dotting the Panhandle plains. It is situated just 30 minutes from the Oklahoma state line, surrounded by golden, rolling hills. Around town, most burned out homes and buildings have been leveled, but traces of the destruction linger.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe ranching industry, the economic anchor of the region, took a sizable hit. About 85% of Texas' beef cattle come from the region. The Smokehouse Creek fire killed more than 15,000 head of cattle, an immense loss in a region where ranching isn't just an industry, but a way of life.\n\ntoggle caption Rachel Osier Lindley/The Texas Newsroom (\n\nThis year, the majority of Texas is facing severe wildfire danger. Wildfires have sprung up across the state in recent weeks, fueled by high winds, dry conditions and warm weather. Texas is also plagued by drought ranging from \"abnormally dry\" to \"extreme drought\" according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.\n\nBecause of all this, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for the state in early March.\n\nRecent studies are finding that climate change could be responsible for wildfires across the country, as was the case of recent wildfires in California.\n\nShane and Tatum Pennington, who manage Fields Ranch outside Canadian, saw the Smokehouse Creek Fire's devastation firsthand. The couple has lived on the comparatively small, 8,000 acres ranch with their family for more than 20 years.\n\n\"It's pretty good country when it rains,\" Shane said from behind the wheel of his white pickup truck. \"But after that fire, we didn't get much rain.\"\n\nFor months after the blaze, Shane's fields were charred black. Now, some green is poking through. But amid ongoing drought conditions, yellow grass covers most of their pastures, leaving little grazing area for the herd.\n\nDriving around the ranch, the Penningtons pointed to scars from the fire's aftermath. Turning into a little pasture next to the Canadian River, Tatum's mind returns to the day after the fire roared through the ranch.\n\n\"When we drove down here, we had no idea what we were fixing to see,\" she said. \"And everywhere you look, there (was) just dead, burnt cattle and calves.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Penningtons' herd is now around 100 head of cattle, about a third of what it was before the fire. The couple have been in recovery mode ever since — burying cattle, ripping up the remains of 100-year-old cottonwood trees and replacing about 18 miles of fences.\n\nOne mile can cost between $15,000 and $20,000, Shane said.\n\n\"We're thinking we've got, maybe another seven or eight miles,\" he said. \"And then we'll be done.\"\n\ntoggle caption Rachel Osier Lindley/The Texas Newsroom\n\nClaims, bills and relief efforts\n\nLandowners across the Panhandle have also been tackling legal claims against Xcel Energy, which provides much of the region's electricity. The fire was still burning last year when Xcel acknowledged one of their power lines started the fire. It is now facing several lawsuits.\n\nAdrian Rodriguez, president of Xcel Energy - New Mexico and Texas, told The Texas Newsroom the company opened up an expedited process to resolve more than half of the 205 claims it's received so far from landowners.\n\n\"We're looking forward to a resolution on every single one of those cases,\" Rodriguez said. \"But we also note that we are in an area with extreme fire danger, with high winds and low humidity and plenty of dry fuels. And as an industry and as a company, we're committed to hardening our system to address these extreme weather conditions.\"\n\nThe Texas Legislature is also taking up a package of bills lawmakers say could help prevent fires like this in the future, as well as pump more money into the volunteer fire departments that make up much of the local firefighting resources in these rural areas.\n\nThe total economic impact of the Smokehouse Creek fire could ultimately exceed $1 billion, according to a report from a special legislative committee.\n\n\"Beauty from the ashes\"\n\nDespite the destruction, residents, businesses and civic leaders rallied to help neighbors who lost their homes and property. Financial contributions, donated supplies and volunteer labor flooded in during the months after the fire. Ezzell Brown said well-wishers sent cattle, hay and other supplies that could have filled up the county's exhibition center 100 times over.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It sounds weird, but as hard as it's been, I wouldn't change what we've been through. Because it's just eye opening,\" said Mallori Wilhelm, a mother of five and the wife of a farmer and rancher who lost her home. \"Good has come from it.\n\n\"Beauty from the ashes. I mean truly.\"\n\ntoggle caption Rachel Osier Lindley/The Texas Newsroom\n\nThe Wilhelms are now settled in a new home in town. While a few families left Canadian after the fire, Hemphill County Judge Lisa Johnson told The Texas Newsroom that most stayed, \"determined to heal their lives and land.\"\n\nThe rebuilding process is something that has given the Penningtons hope.\n\n\"The renewal of it — I'm grateful that my kids are able to experience that,\" said Tatum Pennington. \"We all know how hard life is, and this won't be the first time that they have to do this.\"\n\nBut with drought conditions continuing, they still hold the fear of another wildfire.\n\ntoggle caption Rachel Osier Lindley/The Texas Newsroom\n\n\"We're awful dry right now,\" Shane Pennington said. \"If something sparked, we'd burn again.\""

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThousands of homeowners in Los Angeles are figuring out a way forward after the Palisades and Eaton fires destroyed 16,000 homes and properties across the county. But some of their neighbors who lost their homes in past fires warn that rebuilding will likely be harder than expected.\n\nTwo families whose Malibu homes burned down in the 2018 Woolsey fire told BI they might have sold their properties and moved on if they'd known how lengthy, complicated, expensive, and emotionally taxing the rebuilding process would be.\n\nThat might be why, more than six years after the Woolsey fire destroyed more than 1,600 structures and burned 97,000 acres, only about 40% of the homes that were lost have been replaced.\n\nConstruction costs will likely be even higher for victims of LA's most recent fires, as the scale of the destruction far outstrips past fires and will squeeze a building industry already facing a labor shortage, elevated building material costs, and overwhelming demand.\n\nLosing a home filled with art\n\nJon Krawczyk always knew there was a chance he could lose his Malibu home to a wildfire. But he didn't really believe it until it happened.\n\n\"They say there's a reason young men go to war because they don't think they're going to die, right?\" he told BI. \"I left thinking I'll come back tomorrow, and it'll be here.\"\n\nIt's been two and half years since Krawczyk, a metal sculptor, and his wife, an art consultant, finally broke ground on rebuilding their home of 18 years. That came after a seemingly endless back-and-forth with government officials over permitting and approvals for their project. Krawczyk said authorities required them to rebuild the same structures they had before, even though they wanted one building instead of three, and less square footage.\n\nKrawczyk, who lost his studio and all his equipment on the property, said he initially thought rebuilding would cost about $1.6 million and take about three years, but it's ended up costing north of $2.2 million and taken close to six years.\n\nThe Krawczyks had paid off the mortgage on their home six months before the fire and were able to evacuate with their two teenage kids to a family home. A few months later, they used their insurance payout to buy a home in nearby Thousand Oaks, where they've lived since 2019.\n\nWhile they received their maximum insurance payout and money from a $2.2 billion settlement with Southern California Edison, they lost their insurance provider and had to resort to California's FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort. The plan has high premiums and caps payouts at $3 million.\n\nThe couple hopes to get the final occupancy permit and move into their new house this spring in time to host their son's wedding. But if Krawczyk could turn back time, he's not sure he would've gone through with rebuilding.\n\n\"If I knew then what I know now, I may have just walked away,\" he said, \"because it is not fun.\"\n\nKrawczyk and his wife hope to move into their new home this spring, six and a half years after they lost their old one. Courtesy of Jon Krawczyk\n\nLeaving Malibu\n\nBill and Leslie Bixler had lived in their home in the Malibu hills for about 20 years when the Woolsey fire reduced it to ash.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nIt didn't take long for the couple to get their first payout from their insurance company, but it took about two years to get the permits and other approvals they needed to begin construction on the new, more fire-resistant home.\n\n\"The initial shock of losing material possessions is rough,\" Bill said. \"But the roughest part, actually, for me anyway, was getting the permits and getting through the bureaucracy.\"\n\nBut the couple was determined to rebuild, so they pushed ahead and completed the home about four years after the fire.\n\nWhile the rebuild made sense financially, the Bixlers said that with the benefit of hindsight, they might not have done it.\n\n\"It wasn't worth the pain,\" Leslie said. \"Looking back on it, I wouldn't do it again, I don't think.\"\n\nBill and Leslie Bixler's rebuilt home in Malibu. Courtesy of Bill Bixler\n\nBut years later, the new house still doesn't feel like home.\n\nThey miss Bill's 70-year-old teddy bear and Leslie's mother's Steinway grand piano, which they lost in the fire. Without many of its old trees, the property has lost some of its spirit. \"We had to put so much concrete in to make it fire-safe that we feel like we're in a Lexus commercial,\" Leslie said. \"It's just not the folksy place it was.\"\n\nThe Bixlers are also traumatized by their experience — and fearful of future fires, so they moved out of Malibu for the time being and leased their home to victims of the most recent LA fires. They're living in a rental home in Fresno as they decide what to do next.\n\n\"This last fire was so horrific, and we've just been so stressed out and traumatized from the experience, even though we've done everything in our power to fireproof our house,\" Leslie said. \"We went through all that heartache, but it still didn't take away the pain and the fear of this happening.\"\n\nMany of the Bixler's neighbors never rebuilt their homes, so their neighborhood still \"looks like somebody who's lost half their teeth,\" Bill said. The couple said they know many others who also fear future fires and want to leave Malibu.\n\nBut if you're determined to rebuild, you can, Bill said.\n\n\"You can't get beaten down,\" he said. \"You can always do it, just when you think it's over, it's not.\"\n\nHas your home been impacted by a wildfire or other natural disaster?

        "content": "TYLERTOWN, Miss. — Unusually vicious and damaging weather across multiple U.S. states spawned violent tornadoes, blinding dust storms and fast-moving wildfires over the weekend, leaving at least 39 people dead. In the latest tally of the destruction, the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said Sunday evening that more than 400 homes were damaged as wildfires swept across the state Friday. At least 74 homes in and around Stillwater were destroyed by wildfires, Mayor Will Joyce said Sunday night on Facebook.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe emergency management department also said the Oklahoma Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed four fatalities related to the fires or high winds. The National Weather Service said weekend tornado watches had mostly expired, but dangerous winds were still possible in the Carolinas, east Georgia and northern Florida through Sunday. In Mississippi, Hailey Hart and her fiancé Steve Romero hunkered down with their three huskies inside their 1994 Toyota Celica as a tornado ripped apart their home Saturday in Tylertown. Romero said he prayed out loud and hugged Hart as the car rolled onto its side, windows shattering, before it landed on its wheels again. After the twister passed, they could hear people nearby screaming for help. “It was a bad dream come true,” Romero said. Next door, Hart’s grandparents crawled out from the rubble of their destroyed house after they sought shelter in a bathroom as falling trees collapsed the roof.\n\n“Everything was coming down on us,” said Donna Blansett, Hart’s grandmother. “All I could do was pray to God to save us.” They escaped with just a few scratches and aches. Family members, friends and volunteers spent Sunday removing debris and salvaging anything they could find, including some damp clothes, a photo album and a few toiletries. “I’m so happy you’re alive,” Hart said through tears, as she embraced her grandmother on Sunday. Forecasters warned of dangerous conditions that turned deadly The dynamic storm that began Friday earned an unusual “high risk” designation from weather forecasters. Still, experts said it’s not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. President Donald Trump said in a post on his social media network that his administration is ready to assist affected communities. “Please join Melania and me in praying for everyone impacted by these terrible storms!” he posted Sunday.\n\nAt least three people, including an 82-year-old woman, were killed in central Alabama when multiple tornados swept across the state. In Troy, Alabama, parks officials said the recreation center where many residents had taken refuge had to be closed due to damage from overnight storms. No one was injured. “We are thankful the Lord provided protection over our community, and over 200 guests at the Recreation Center storm shelter on Saturday night,” the parks department said in a statement. Fatalities from twisters in battered Missouri reach 12 Missouri resident Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing trapped neighbors found five bodies scattered in rubble Friday night outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County. Scattered twisters killed at least a dozen people in the state, authorities said. “It’s really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night,” Henderson said Saturday, not far from the splintered home he said they rescued his aunt through a window of the only room left standing.\n\nCoroner Jim Akers of Butler County, Missouri, described the home where one man was killed as “just a debris field.” “The floor was upside down,” he said. “We were walking on walls.” Deaths in Mississippi and Arkansas In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves announced that six people died and more than 200 were displaced after tornadoes sowed devastation across three counties. And in the northern part of the state, roads were inundated and some people were stranded by flood waters. One of the deaths occurred in Covington County, where Seminary resident Traci Ladner said she watched a tornado knock down trees and power lines and destroy a house Saturday as she drove home from Ward’s Restaurant. The twister touched down briefly, traveled over Highway 49 and then went back up before making another quick descent, she said. “I was crying. My legs were shaking. It was pretty scary,” she said. In Arkansas, officials confirmed three deaths.\n\nWildfires and dust storms drive up the death toll Wind-driven wildfires caused extensive damage in Texas and Oklahoma and officials warned Sunday that parts of both states would again face an increased risk of fire danger in the coming week. More than 130 fires were reported across Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt said. “Nobody has enough resources to fight fires when the wind is blowing 70 mph,” said Terry Essary, the fire chief of Stillwater, Oklahoma. “It’s an insurmountable task.” Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management spokesperson Keli Cain said Sunday that two people were killed as a result of the wildfires and weather. Meanwhile, dust storms spurred by high winds claimed almost a dozen lives on Friday. Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle.\n\n—Reynolds reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

This week’s blazes were in part fueled by downed timber from the hurricane, coupled with wind and dry conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere’s how you can help victims and first responders in the Carolinas. Associa Cares Associa Cares was created to help families and communities in the wake of disasters. The organization aims to provide direct financial relief to those impacted and has already earmarked $100,000 to support individuals and families affected by the recent wildfires across North and South Carolina. American Red Cross The American Red Cross has been providing emergency assistance and disaster relief for over a century. The organization has opened an evacuation shelter in South Carolina and is supporting several shelters in North Carolina. While it says it no longer is in need of supplies to help wildfire survivors, the organization is still accepting monetary donations. World Central Kitchen World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit food relief organization founded by celebrity chef José Andrés, is often on the ground providing meals for victims and first responders of disasters around the world. The organization is currently in North Carolina providing meals for first responders.\n\nSouth Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (SCVOAD)\n\nSouth Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, an offshoot of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, is an association of groups that help provide services to communities affected by disaster. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division “ways to help” webpage directs individuals to make monetary donations to SCVOAD, and contact them for volunteer opportunities.\n\nCity of Walhalla Fire Department\n\nThe city of Walhalla's fire department has posted a list of needed items for the 400 first responders combating fires in South Carolina. The department asks that the requested items, which range from eye drops to safety goggles, are delivered by Friday, March 28."

Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days.\n\nOvernight into Sunday morning there were new tornado warnings issued in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in several counties in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee.\n\nDay after day of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach what the agency calls \"major flood stage,\" with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee.\n\nA 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky including a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said.\n\nAlso Saturday, a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided.\n\nTornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths.\n\nThere were 521 flights cancelled and more than 6,400 flights delayed within the U.S. or coming into or leaving the country on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday.\n\nInterstate commerce also could be affected. The extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nThe outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts, twice that of just a decade ago.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLouisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days.\n\n\"We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,\" he said.\n\ntoggle caption Jon Cherry/AP\n\nFlash flood threat looms over many states\n\nFlash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning.\n\nHundreds of Kentucky roads across the state were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides.\n\nDowntown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, reopened in the morning after floodwaters from the Little River receded, giving a much-needed reprieve, but still more rainfall was on its way, Mayor James R. Knight Jr. said.\n\n\"We got a little rain, but most of it went north of us,\" Knight said. \"Thank goodness on that. Gave us a little break.\"\n\nIn north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.\n\nIn Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding.\n\nBNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by floodwaters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen.\n\ntoggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nWhy so much nasty weather?\n\nSince Wednesday, more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday.\n\nForecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state's emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding.\n\nIn Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities.\n\nAmong them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage.\n\n\"I grabbed all my stuff and came here,\" said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: \"I don't leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed. I have to make sure I have them with me.\""

Spiderman toys and letters of the alphabet are scattered among broken chairs, tables and garden slides at the remains of this preschool destroyed by the huge earthquake that hit Myanmar on Friday. It is in the town of Kyaukse, about 40km (25 miles) south of Mandalay, one of the areas hit hardest by the 7.7 magnitude quake that killed at least 2,000 people.\n\nKywe Nyein wept as he spoke about the death of his five-year-old granddaughter in the earthquake\n\nKywe Nyein, 71, weeps as he explains that his family are preparing to hold the funeral of his five-year-old granddaughter, Thet Hter San. He says her mother was having lunch when the devastating earthquake began. She ran to the school, but the building had collapsed completely. The little girl's body was found about three hours later. \"Fortunately, we got our beloved's body intact, in one piece,\" he says.\n\nThet Hter San was one of at least 12 children who died at the preschool, along with a teacher\n\nLocals say there were about 70 children, aged between two and seven, at the school on Friday, learning happily. But now there is little left except a pile of bricks, concrete and iron rods. The school says 12 children and a teacher died, but locals believe the number is at least 40 - that is how many were in the downstairs section that collapsed. Residents and parents are distraught. People say the whole town came to help with the rescue work and several bodies were retrieved on Friday. They describe mothers crying and calling out the names of their children long into the night. Now, three days later, the site is quiet. People look at me with grief etched on their faces.\n\nLocals believe as many as 40 children died when the lower level of the preschool collapsed\n\nAid groups are warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, with hospitals damaged and overwhelmed, though the full scale of devastation is still emerging. Before we arrived in Kyaukse, we had been in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw. The worst-hit area we saw there was a building that had been residential quarters for civil servants. The whole ground floor had collapsed, leaving the three upper floors still standing on top of it. There were traces of blood in the rubble. The intense stench suggested many people had died there, but there was no sign of rescue work.\n\nIt is not clear how many people died when this civil service residential building in Nay Pyi Taw collapsed\n\nA group of policemen were loading furniture and household goods on to trucks, and appeared to be trying to salvage what was still useable. The police officer in charge would not give us an interview, though we were allowed to film for a while. We could see people mourning and desolate, but they did not want to speak to the media, fearing reprisals from the military government. We were left with so many questions. How many people were under the rubble? Could any of them still be alive? Why was there no rescue work, even to retrieve the bodies of the dead?\n\nInjured people were being treated in makeshift tents outside the capital's biggest hospital in sweltering heat\n\nJust 10 minutes' drive away, we had visited the capital's largest hospital - known here as the \"1,000-bed hospital\". The roof of the emergency room had collapsed. At the entrance, a sign saying \"Emergency Department\" in English lay on the ground. There were six military medical trucks and several tents outside, where patients evacuated from the hospital were being cared for. The tents were being sprayed with water to give those inside some relief from the intense heat. It looked like there were about 200 injured people there, some with bloodied heads, others with broken limbs. We saw an official angrily reprimanding staff about other colleagues who had not turned up to work during the emergency. I realised the man was the minister for health, Dr Thet Khaing Win, and approached him for an interview but he curtly rejected my request."

        "content": "AI-assisted summary Despite recent rainfall, both Volusia and Flagler counties remain below average rainfall levels and at an elevated risk for wildfires.\n\nDry conditions are expected to return by mid-week and continue through April.\n\nAfter a late afternoon drenching on Sunday, there’s more rain on the way Monday in Daytona Beach as well as other parts of Volusia and Flagler counties, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nScattered lightning storms were forecast to develop again Monday afternoon and evening, with conditions favorable for a few of the storms to become strong, especially along the coast, according to a hazardous weather outlook issued by the National Weather Service in Melbourne.\n\nThe main storm hazards will be gusty winds up to around 50 mph, lightning strikes, small hail and locally heavy downpours.\n\nDespite that rainfall, conditions are expected to turn dry again starting on Wednesday, said Tim Sedlock, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Melbourne. There will still be an elevated fire risk due to a combination of low humidity, gusty winds and dry conditions, he said.\n\n“It wasn't a widespread rain across the county,\" Sedlock said. \"It (the weekend rain) isn’t going to change things until we get more average rainfall in more of a normal pattern (that includes afternoon thunderstorms) with more rainfall in some of these areas.”\n\nA moderate risk of life-threatening rip currents also exists for all of coastal Volusia and Flagler counties. Those at area beaches are advised to always swim near a lifeguard and never enter the water alone. The rip current risk will continue all week, according to forecasters.\n\nHow much weekend rain fell in Daytona Beach, nearby areas?\n\nRainfall totals on Sunday ranged from roughly half an inch to about 2.5 inches in various spots throughout Volusia and Flagler counties, Sedlock said.\n\nAbout .55 inches of rain was reported at Daytona International Airport, while some spots in north-central Volusia reported between 2 and 2.5 inches.\n\nThere also was 2.5 inches of rain reported south of Edgewater, near the Brevard County line, a little more than the 1.7 inches logged in the city limits, Sedlock said.\n\nNearly an inch of rain was reported in Oak Hill.\n\nTo the north, Ormond Beach reported 1.2 inches.\n\nIn Flagler County, most of the heaviest rain fell in the interior areas, with Bunnell reporting .75 inches and neighboring Andalusia logging nearly an inch.\n\nCoastal area including Flagler Beach reported from .2 to .4 inches, with Palm Coast receiving .65 inches of rain based on radar estimates, Sedlock said.\n\nWill weekend rains in Daytona Beach ease drought, fire concerns?\n\nAlthough the rains helped some, both Volusia and Flagler remain below average rainfall levels, Sedlock said.\n\nNormal rainfall for March in Daytona Beach is 3.16 inches, but the total had only reached 0.98 inches by Monday, he said.\n\nLikewise, the Daytona Beach rain total through the first three months of 2025 is 3.92 inches, down significantly from the normal amount of 8.23 inches.\n\nThose conditions won’t improve until the area starts to move into its predictable summer rain pattern of heavy, nearly daily afternoon showers, Sedlock said. “Generally, that doesn’t start before mid-May or the end of June. April is the driest month of the year for us.”\n\nIn Flagler, firefighters with Flagler County Fire Rescue battled a 40-acre wildfire Saturday in the area of Kelly Street in Flagler Estates, according to a post on the department's Facebook page. The fire was reported to be 100% contained by Sunday morning.\n\nPrecipitation levels are below normal levels in Flagler, according to the latest climate update issued by Bob Pickering, county emergency management specialist.\n\nAbnormally dry conditions are expected countywide, according to the county’s latest update. Above normal temperatures and above normal wildfire potential is anticipated through April, the update states.\n\nIn February, the most recent figures available, Palm Coast received 1.43 inches of rain, part of a year-to-date total of 3.88 inches, according to the county’s update. Bunnell received 1.17 inches, contributing to a year-to-date total of 3.88 inches.\n\nNormal precipitation for the Flagler region for February is 2.67 inches, contributing to normal year-to-date rainfall of 5.41 inches, the report states.\n\nRatings are on the rise for both Volusia and Flagler counties on the Keetch-Byram index, a continuous reference scale for estimating the dryness of the soil reported by the Florida Department of Agriculture. Normal range is 241-460.\n\nOn Monday, Volusia County was above that range, at 495, up from 481 on Friday.

The North Carolina Department of Public Safety announced a mandatory evacuation starting at 8:20 p.m. Saturday for parts of Polk County in western North Carolina about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Visibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,” the agency said in a social media post. The public safety department said a shelter had been established in Columbus, North Carolina. The North Carolina Forest Service's online wildfire public viewer indicated three active fires in Polk County, with the two largest spanning between 1.7 square miles (4.4 square kilometers) to 1.9 square miles (4.9 square kilometers). Two other fires were active in nearby Burke and Madison counties, with a third wildfire burning in Stokes County on the northern border with Virginia. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Saturday as part of an effort to stop a blaze in Pickens County called the Table Rock Fire that started the previous day in an area within the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\n“As this wildfire continues to spread, the State of Emergency allows us to mobilize resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need to protect lives and property,” McMaster said in a statement that reinforced a statewide outdoor burning ban issued Friday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission. Local fire officials called for voluntary evacuations Saturday of some residents near Table Rock Mountain, the forestry commission said in a social media post. The Pickens County Sheriff's Office posted an update late Saturday saying crews had ceased operations and would resume Sunday morning with ground personnel and machinery and assistance from helicopters and air tankers. The fire was about 110 acres (45 hectares) and the public was asked to avoid state Highway 11. North Carolina's western region already had been hit hard by Hurricane Helene in September. Among the extensive damage, flooding washed away more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) of eastbound lanes on Interstate 40 leading to eastern Tennessee and remained partially closed to traffic until March.\n\nThe hurricane damaged or impacted 5,000 miles (8,046 kilometers) of state-maintained roads and damaged 7,000 private roads, bridges and culverts in North Carolina.\n\nThe California Branch wildfire burns in New Jersey's Wharton State Forest on Saturday, March 22, 2025.

The fire had consumed about 2.7 square miles (7 square kilometers) as of early Sunday morning. Firefighters had contained about half of the blaze according to an 8 a.m. update on the service's Facebook page. Emergency officials said they have evacuated two campgrounds in the park. Eighteen buildings were near the fire but the flames were moving away from them and no structures had been evacuated.\n\nThe cause of the fire is under investigation."

        "content": "Why earthquake predictions are usually wrong\n\n22 March 2025 Share Save Ana Faguy BBC News, Washington DC Christal Hayes BBC News, Los Angeles Max Matza BBC News, Seattle Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nBrent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor. In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka. Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one. \"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve. But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say. It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.\n\nGetty Images The Northridge earthquake, in Los Angeles, which killed 57 and injured thousands, was the deadliest earthquake in the US in recent memory\n\nLucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events. For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Dr Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code. \"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\" With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning. The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows. The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction. It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur. Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Dr Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare. The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region. While the guess was correct, Dr Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy. There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Dr Jones said. The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet. Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".\n\nGetty Images San Francisco was in ruins after the 1906 earthquake\n\nThe agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come. Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis. While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region. Dr Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them. \"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\" Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade. Why earthquakes made Los Angeles shake like a bowl full of jelly\n\nHow climate change worsens heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and floods\n\nThousands evacuate Santorini as more earthquakes strike island The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use. But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting. At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030. While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur. \"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\" This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Dr Jones said. \"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said. \"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\"\n\nWatch: How people have prepared for earthquakes through the years in California\n\nHow you can prepare for the uncertainty of a quake"

But some of them discovered after the fire that their insurance policies wouldn't cover the full cost of rebuilding — or of the personal belongings they lost.\n\nWilliam Buckley, a Malibu native who works in financial services, said he had a good experience with his provider — AAA home insurance — after the fire. It was quick to send him his initial payouts and responsive to his requests.\n\n\"We were never left in the lurch,\" Buckley said. \"We were never left holding an invoice and waiting for money.\"\n\nJon Krawczyk's Malibu property after the Woolsey fire. Courtesy of Jon Krawczyk\n\nBut Buckley quickly learned that he was underinsured. While he ultimately received about $1.1 million in insurance payouts , he said , he spent about $1.6 million, he said. He took out a FEMA disaster relief loan and got much-needed cash from Southern California Edison's $2.2 billion legal settlement . But he and his wife still depleted their savings to cover the rest of the costs. They weren't alone. \"Every one of my neighbors I knew was underinsured,\" Buckley said.\n\nRichard Gibbs, a film and TV composer and owner of Woodshed Recording studio, had a much less positive experience with his home insurance provider, State Farm. Gibbs struggled to get the company to cover rent on the temporary home he and his family wanted to live in. When Gibbs realized that he'd lost all of his original scores, which an appraiser valued at $2.1 million, State Farm refused to reimburse more than $5,000 for them, Gibbs said.\n\nThe problem of underinsurance is widespread: A study published last year of wildfire-related insurance claims in Colorado found that nearly three-quarters of those affected by the Marshall Fire of 2021 weren't fully covered by their policies. Rebuilding a home in the future — and replacing everything in it — often costs much more than its current value, as estimated by an insurance company. Policies that cover the cash value of a home rather than the full cost of replacing it often leave homeowners without enough funds to rebuild. Gibbs and his wife ended up suing State Farm for allegedly underpaying and delaying their claims. They settled for an amount Gibbs said he couldn't disclose.\n\nWhen Gibbs talks to other homeowners worried about a potential future wildfire, he tells them all one thing: \"Make sure that your insurance policy truly covers your house in case it burns down because most do not,\" he said.\n\nState Farm didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWilliam Buckley said his home and surrounding landscaping in Malibu were finally complete about five years after the Woolsey fire. Courtesy of William Buckley\n\nAn endless permitting process\n\nSome fire victims struggled with city and other government permitting processes to rebuild, despite local authorities' promises to fast-track them.\n\nJon Krawczyk, a metal sculptor who also lost his home in Malibu, said authorities required him to rebuild the same structures he had before, even though he wanted one building instead of three and less square footage.\n\n\"There was no wisdom,\" Krawczyk said of the permitting process, adding that local authorities weren't flexible with the rules, even when his plans would've resulted in less construction.\n\nBallooning construction costs\n\nMany fire victims said the cost of construction was ultimately much higher than they'd expected. Some homeowners were in the middle of the rebuilding process when COVID-19 hit, and demand for housing, construction materials, and labor soared. The pandemic also snarled building material supply chains, sending prices even higher.\n\nBuckley and his family moved into their new home in June 2021, even as they continued construction on it. \"It was just a structure in a rubble field, basically,\" he said. The home and landscaping were completed at the end of 2023, almost exactly five years after the fire.\n\nWilliam Buckley's home was finally completed five years after the November 2018 Woolsey fire. Courtesy of William Buckley\n\nAs Gibbs hopes to finally break ground on his new home this year, he's bracing for increased competition for building materials and labor, given that many victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires will likely also want to start rebuilding as quickly as possible.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nMoving on — or away\n\nDespite designing their new homes to be far more resistant to future fires, some who've rebuilt live in fear of the next major disaster. Many are also struggling with the lasting emotional toll of losing their homes.\n\nThe devastating LA wildfires this winter, which also destroyed homes in Malibu, have exacerbated that fear. It's not just neighborhoods nestled into the hills or near the urban-wildland interface that can feel vulnerable these days.\n\n\"You could be in the middle of LA, and a fire can sweep through the neighborhood with the kind of winds we have,\" Buckley said.\n\nThe Bixlers were so traumatized by their experience — and fearful of future fires, that they moved out of Malibu and leased their home to victims of the most recent LA fires.

Courtesy of Jon Krawczyk\n\n\"This last fire was so horrific, and we've just been so stressed out and traumatized from the experience, even though we've done everything in our power to fireproof our house,\" Leslie said. \"We went through all that heartache, but it still didn't take away the pain and the fear of this happening.\"\n\nMany of the Bixlers' neighbors never rebuilt their homes, so their neighborhood still \"looks like somebody who's lost half their teeth,\" Bill said. The couple said they know many others who also fear future fires and want to leave Malibu.\n\nGibbs said he's also considered leaving LA County because of \"the insanity of the costs and insurance\" made worse by the recent fires.\n\nBuckley said that, for a long time, it was hard for him to talk with anyone who hadn't lost their home to a fire about the experience. He felt he'd joined a \"club\" of fire victims.\n\n\"At first, you don't even want to communicate with your old club, you're in this different club now,\" Buckley said. \"They don't understand the extent of the trauma.

        "content": "What caused the Myanmar earthquake - and why did it make a tower in Bangkok collapse?\n\n31 March 2025 Share Save Esme Stallard Climate and science reporter, BBC News Vicky Wong BBC News Share Save\n\nMoment Bangkok high-rise collapses following Myanmar earthquake\n\nA major earthquake in Myanmar on Friday has caused more than 3,000 deaths and led to the collapse of numerous structures. Even though the south-east Asian nation is a high risk region for earthquakes, neighbouring Thailand and China - which were also affected by the quake - are not. The Thai capital, Bangkok, sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) from the epicentre of Friday's earthquake - and yet an unfinished high-rise building in the city was felled by it. Here we will explain what caused this earthquake, and how it was able to have such a powerful effect so far away.\n\nWhat caused the earthquake?\n\nThe earth's upper layer is split into different sections, called tectonic plates, which are all moving constantly. Some move alongside each other, whilst others are above and below each other. It is this movement that causes earthquakes and volcanoes. Myanmar is considered to be one of the most geologically \"active\" areas in the world because it sits on top of the convergence of four of these tectonic plates - the Eurasian plate, the Indian plate, the Sunda plate and the Burma microplate. The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate, and the 2004 Tsunami as a result of the Indian plate moving beneath the Burma microplate. Dr Rebecca Bell, a reader in tectonics at Imperial College London, said that to accommodate all of this motion, faults - cracks in the rock - form which allow tectonic plates to \"slither\" sideways. There is a major fault called the Sagaing fault, which cuts right through Myanmar north to south and is more than 1,200km (746 miles) long. Early data suggests that the movement that caused Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake was a \"strike-slip\" - where two blocks move horizontally along each other. This aligns with the movement typical of the Sagaing fault. As the plates move past each other, they can become stuck, building friction until it is suddenly released and the earth shifts, causing an earthquake.\n\nWhy was the earthquake felt so far away?\n\nEarthquakes can happen at up to 700km (435 miles) below the surface. This one was just 10km from the surface, making it very shallow. This increases the amount of shaking at the surface. The earthquake was also very large - measuring 7.7 on the moment scale. It produced more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey. The size of the quake was because of the type of fault, said Dr Bell. \"The straight nature [of the fault] means earthquakes can rupture over large areas - and the larger the area of the fault that slips, the larger the earthquake,\" she explained. \"There have been six magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in this region in the last century.\" This straight fault also means a lot of the energy can be carried down its length - which extends for 1,200km south towards Thailand. When it comes to why the earth shook so much, scientists believe it is because the quake was a rare \"super shear\" - meaning energy from the rupture in the earth's crust built up because it was moving faster than seismic waves can travel through the earth. Seismologist Prof Frederik Tilmann, from the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences in Germany, explained in analysis shared online that the rupture travelled at a speed of about 5km per second - making it \"the earthquake equivalent of a supersonic jet\". Because the fracture \"unzipped\" towards the south, it also directed this piled up energy towards the Thai capital, Bangkok, and this is why the earthquake had such an impact so far away. How earthquakes are felt at the surface is also determined by the type of soil. In soft soil - which is what Bangkok is built on - seismic waves (the vibrations of the earth) slow down and build up, getting bigger in size. So, Bangkok's geology would have made the ground shaking more intense.\n\nWhy did just one skyscraper collapse in Bangkok?\n\nWhile dramatic footage has emerged of high-rise buildings in Bangkok swaying during the quake - knocking water from rooftop pools - the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office Bangkok's Chatuchak district appears to be the only skyscraper to collapse. Prior to 2009, Bangkok did not have a comprehensive safety standard for constructing buildings to withstand earthquakes, according to Dr Christian Málaga-Chuquitaype, a senior lecturer in earthquake engineering at Imperial College London. This means that older buildings would have been particularly vulnerable. This is not unusual, as earthquake-resistant buildings can be more expensive to construct and Thailand, unlike Myanmar, does not frequently experience earthquakes. Dr Emily So, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Cambridge, noted that older buildings can and have been strengthened, such as in California, western Canada and New Zealand.\n\nWatch: Dashcam captures moment Bangkok building collapses\n\nProf Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, said that while there were regulations in 43 provinces on earthquake-proofing buildings, less than 10% of buildings are estimated to be quake-resistant. Yet the building that collapsed was new - in fact, it was still under construction when the earthquake hit - and the updated building standards would have applied. Dr Pimarnmas said Bangkok's soft soil may have also played a part in its collapse, as it can amplify ground motions three or four times over. He added: \"However, there are other assumptions such as material (concrete and reinforcements) quality and some irregularity in [the] structural system. These remain to be investigated in detail.\" Having studied the video, Dr Málaga-Chuquitaype said it appears a \"flat slab\" construction process was being favoured - which is no longer recommended in earthquake-prone areas. \"A 'flat slab' system is a way of constructing buildings where floors are made to rest directly on columns, without using beams,\" he explained. \"Imagine a table supported only by legs, with no extra horizontal supports underneath. \"While this design has cost and architectural advantages, is performs poorly during earthquakes, often failing in a brittle and sudden (almost explosive) manner.\"\n\nWhat about the buildings in Myanmar?"

Relief efforts are focused on Myanmar, where the estimated death toll rose to 1,644 by Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe number of dead from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake is expected to increase, while the number of injured was at 3,408 and the missing figure rose was 139 on Sunday. The earthquake's epicenter was near Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city with 1.5 million people. In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17.\n\nWhile food, medicine and other vital supplies have reached Myanmar, a report issued Saturday by the U.N.

But most teams were finding only bodies.\n\nThe quake hit midday Friday, toppling thousands of buildings, collapsing bridges and buckling roads. The death toll rose to 3,003 on Wednesday, with more than 4,500 people injured, MRTV reported.

        "content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Parts of the South and Midwest, still reeling from violent storms, tornadoes and flooding that have killed more than a dozen people, face new flooding and tornado warnings that forecasters said could last for days. Severe thunderstorms have swept through a swath of the country with a population of 2.3 million people from northeast Texas through Arkansas and into southeast Missouri. Read More: How to Best Prepare For a Storm, According to the Experts\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat has happened? In Kentucky, more than 500 roads were closed by Sunday because of the floods and mudslides. Two people were killed, including a 9-year-old boy who was swept away as he walked to a school bus stop. The downtown area of Hopkinsville, Kentucky — a city of 31,000 residents 72 miles (116 kilometers) northwest of Nashville, Tennessee — was submerged. The first wave of storms killed at least five people in Tennessee and one each in Missouri and Indiana on Wednesday and Thursday. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee called the devastation in his state “enormous” and said it was too early to know whether there were more deaths as searches continued. There was massive destruction in Lake City in eastern Arkansas, where homes were flattened and cars were flipped and tossed into trees. More than 300 tornado warnings were issued by the National Weather Service since the tornado outbreak began early Wednesday, and new warnings followed overnight in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. The number of tornado warnings eclipsed those issued during last month’s deadly outbreak in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and other states.\n\nNot all tornado warnings involve an actual tornado, and it was too early to know how many were actually produced by the current outbreak. The severe weather also caused travel headaches. Hundreds of flights have been canceled and more than 6,400 flights delayed, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. The flooding also led to road closures in Kentucky and southern Illinois, among other places. The severe weather hit at a time when nearly half the National Weather Service's forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates — twice that of a decade ago — according to data obtained by The Associated Press. What's causing this wave of storms? Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. The prolonged deluge, which could dump more than a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over a four-day period, “is an event that happens once in a generation to once in a lifetime,” the National Weather Service said.\n\nWhat's next? Private forecasting company AccuWeather said northeastern Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois, western Kentucky and northwestern Tennessee needed to prepare for a catastrophic risk from flash flooding. “This is a rare and dangerous atmospheric setup,” said Jonathan Porter, AccuWeather chief meteorologist. Forecasters have also warned of major disruptions to shipping and supply chains. Shipping giant FedEx, for example, has a massive facility in the danger area, in Memphis Tennessee. Barge transportation on the lower Mississippi River could also be affected. Water rescue teams and sandbags were being set up across the region in anticipation of flooding, and authorities warned people to take the threat of rising water seriously and to not drive through water. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said flooding had reached record levels in many communities. “Kentuckians and communities have been affected across the state, and teams are working around the clock to support them,” he said Sunday on social media platform X.\n\n—Associated Press writers George Walker IV in Selmer, Tennessee; John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee; Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, Seth Borenstein in Washington; Bruce Schreiner in Shelbyville, Kentucky; and Sophia Tareen in Chicago, contributed."

        "content": "OMAHA, Neb. — Another storm system affected millions of people in the middle of the U.S. on Wednesday, leaving parts of the Midwest and Great Plains under blizzard conditions and a broad swath of neighboring states at risk of high winds and wildfires. Roughly 72 million people were under a wind advisory or warning, with winds gusting over 45 mph (72 kph), according to Bryan Jackson, a National Weather Service meteorologist. At this time of year, cold air lingering in the north collides with warm air from the south to produce strong, low pressure systems, Jackson said. But he added that the latest weather was the third storm system to rapidly develop in recent weeks and bring high winds to a large swath of the U.S., a “very active pattern\" since February.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt least 42 people died over the weekend when dynamic storms unleashed tornadoes, blinding dust and wildfires, uprooting trees and flattening hundreds of homes and businesses across eight states in the South and Midwest. Read More: Amid Major U.S. Storm Warnings, Experts Share Tips on How to Best Prepare Snow for some A band from southwestern Kansas to central Wisconsin was expected to bring as little as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow or as much as a foot (30 centimeters). Combined with high winds, forecasters warned of whiteout conditions. The Kansas Department of Transportation temporarily closed more than 250 miles (400 kilometers) of Interstate 70 from the Colorado border east to Salina, Kansas. By Wednesday night, nearly all of it had been reopened due to improved road conditions. The first stretch to close in western Kansas was also impacted by last week's high winds when eight people died after a dust storm resulted in a pileup of 71 cars and trucks.\n\nBlizzard conditions early Wednesday led to near-zero visibility in south-central Nebraska, the state patrol said via Facebook, urging people to stay off the roads. There were road closures of more than 160 miles (255 kilometers) of I-80 from Lincoln to Lexington and nearly 70 miles (115 kilometers) of I-29 along the Nebraska-Iowa border. Stalled cars, jackknifed semitrailers, crashes and downed power lines contributed to the chaos. Around the Iowa-Illinois border, more than an inch of snow was falling per hour, while gusts were as high as 30 mph (48 kph), according to the National Weather Service. Heavy snow and high winds knocked down tree branches and snapped utility poles. Power was knocked out to more than 140,000 customers in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee and Indiana, according to PowerOutage.us. The storm left many with weather whiplash following a springlike Tuesday with temperatures topping 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) in some parts.\n\nHigh winds and risk of fires Where it was not snowing, there were still very strong winds. Gusts combined with dry conditions from Texas and Oklahoma through Arkansas and central Missouri raised the wildfire potential. \"Before plants are growing,” Jackson said, “there's a lot of dry fuel out there.” The fire threat ramped up Tuesday and persisted Wednesday with renewed risk in parts of Oklahoma still reeling from an outbreak of blazes that started Friday. More than 400 homes were severely damaged or destroyed, and at least four people died due to the fires or high winds, officials said. The Texas A&M Forest Service reported that it responded to 14 new wildfires Tuesday that burned about 29 square miles (75 square kilometers) across Texas. The agency responded to a fire of about 3 square miles (8 square kilometers) the following day in San Jacinto County, with just a small fraction of it contained.\n\nOne fire near Borger, in the state's panhandle, cut power, led to evacuations and threatened more than 1,000 late Tuesday, the city said via Facebook. “Through quick response and collaborative effort from many departments around our region, the fire remained outside of the City limits, and we did not lose any of those 1201 homes,” the city said. As of Wednesday night, that fire, originally spanning 350 acres (140 hectares), covered an estimated 500 acres (200 hectares) and was 75% contained, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. Crews also responded to dozens of fires in Arkansas, where winds posed additional risk. Four homes in Little Rock were heavily damaged in the southwest part of the city, Fire Chief Delphone Hubbard said during a news briefing, but no fatalities or injuries were reported. Mayor Frank Scott urged people to heed a burn ban for Pulaski County, saying, “Please do not do anything reckless or careless, because it could create a loss of life.\"\n\nPart of I-530 southeast of Little Rock was shut down because of smoke from a grass fire, but traffic resumed by the evening. The midsection of the state saw wind gusts as high as 59 mph (95 kph), according to the National Weather Service. In New Mexico, where massive walls of dust forced highway closures and resulted in power outages Tuesday, forecasters warned of a return of critical fire weather conditions on Thursday.\n\nDozens Killed in Massive Storm as Tornadoes and Wildfires Sweep Across U.S.\n\nTornadoes possible Severe thunderstorms were possible in central Illinois with risks of hail, strong wind and tornadoes. Much of Illinois and Indiana were forecast to be under slight risk, with lower risk farther south through the Tennessee Valley.\n\nSevere storms brought strong winds to Indiana, and hail and tornadoes threatened part of the state, the National Weather Service said.\n\nLooking eastward\n\nJackson said the storm would send a cold front across the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday with potential heavy snowfall at higher elevations in New England.\n\n—Fingerhut reported from Des Moines, Iowa. Associated Press writers John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Hallie Golden in Seattle contributed."

        "content": "Alysa Liu ends long U.S. drought at women's figure skating world championships\n\ntoggle caption Charles Krupa/AP\n\nBOSTON — Alysa Liu skated around the ice in disbelief, her golden dress shimmering in the lights of TD Garden, and the appreciative roar from a sellout crowd reminded her why she had returned to the sport following a nearly two-year retirement.\n\nWhen her score was finally read, the 19-year-old from Clovis, California, had made history.\n\nLiu became the first American women's figure skating world champion in nearly two decades, dethroning three-time defending champ Kaori Sakamoto with a brilliant free skate Friday night. Her program to a rendition of \"MacArthur Park\" by Boston native Donna Summer earned her a standing ovation, and allowed Liu to finish with 222.97 points.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I mean, it means so much to me and everything I've been through,\" Liu said. \"My last skating experience, my time away and this time around — I'm so happy, I guess. I'm mostly glad I could put out two of my best performances.\"\n\nLiu's coaches, Phillip DiGuglielmo and Massimo Scali, pulled her into a hug in the kiss-and-cry area of the arena. Moments later, Sakamoto came over from where she had watched in the leader's chair and squeezed her tightly, as if Japan's hero was passing Liu the torch as the first world champion from the U.S. since Kimmie Meissner stood atop the podium in 2006.\n\n\"What the hell?\" Liu asked in disbelief. \"I don't know. I don't know how to process this.\"\n\nSakamoto finished with 217.98 points to add a silver medal to her three previous golds. Her Japanese teammate, Mone Chiba, was third with 215.24 points while Isabeau Levito and Amber Glenn gave the Americans three of the top five.\n\n\"We are all so strong,\" Levito said, \"and we are all such fighters, and we all have our strengths, and are so different but we're all so sweet with each other. I'm just so glad these are my fellow Team USA skaters.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLiu was once considered the sport's rising star, the youngest-ever U.S. champ when she triumphed at the age of 13 in 2019, and then defended her title the following year. She fulfilled a childhood ambition by qualifying for the Olympics, finishing sixth at the 2022 Beijing Games, and earned a bronze medal at the world championships that year.\n\nThen she stepped away. Liu decided that skating had become less of joy and more of a job, and she wanted to focus on being a normal college student. It wasn't until she went on a ski trip and felt the rush of competition — albeit in a much different way, and with far lower stakes — that she began to think about a comeback.\n\nEarly last year, she made it official with a cryptic posting on social media. And while the path back in a notoriously fickle sport was bumpy, to be sure, Liu took a big step forward with her second-place finish to Glenn at the U.S. championships.\n\nShe took the last step up on the podium Friday night.\n\n\"Not every yesterday, I didn't expect this. I didn't have expectations coming in,\" Liu said. \"I never have expectations coming into competitions anymore. It's moreso, 'What can I put out performance-wise?' I really met my expectations on my part.\"\n\nShe left Sakamoto, the erstwhile champion, with feelings of awe and admiration.\n\n\"She went away and now she's back, and the world champion,\" Sakamoto said. \"I wouldn't say she's changed. Her cheerfulness and kindness and the way she's always happy brought her to the stop step of the podium.\"\n\nEarlier in the night, American ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates built a big cushion as they chase their third consecutive title, scoring a season-best 90.18 points for their rhythm dance to lead Canadian rivals Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGilles and Poirier scored 86.44 points to their dance, set to music from The Beach Boys. They held the lead only long enough for the U.S. duo to finish their \"tour of the decades\" program, which earned them a raucous ovation inside TD Garden.\n\nThe International Skating Union chose the theme this season of social dances and styles of the 1950's, 60's and 70's. But while some skaters picked one — the Watusi, the Madison or disco — Chock and Bates threw it all into their rollicking showcase.\n\n\"It was probably the most fun I've had thus far on competitive ice in a performance, maybe ever,\" Chock said. \"It was really a joy to perform in front of a home crowd and share that excitement with Evan. It was the best.\"\n\nNow, Chock and Bates will try to finish off the first three-peat since Russia's Oksana Grishuk and Evgeni Platov in the 1990s.\n\n\"That's a tough amount of points to catch up on,\" Poirier admitted, \"but we also know that sport is really unpredictable.\""

        "content": "Damage surveys provide crucial information about when, where and how strong U.S. tornadoes are to better understand disaster risk\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service forecasts tornado outbreaks—often days in advance—and issues the watches and warnings that help people know when and how to prepare and when to take cover. NWS researchers also perform another task that is less recognized but crucial: conducting damage surveys in the wake of tornadoes such as those that struck parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana this week.\n\nTo learn more about why these surveys of the devastation wrought by tornadoes is so important, Scientific American spoke with tornado researcher Jana Houser of the Ohio State University.\n\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nWhy do researchers conduct damage surveys after a tornado hits?\n\nThe biggest reason is to develop a climatological database for when tornadoes are occurring, where tornadoes are occurring and how intense tornadoes are.\n\nWith a hurricane, you send a hurricane hunter aircraft in the air, and it drops an instrument package called a dropsonde through the hurricane. That instrument, as it is descending, acquires information about the temperature, the pressure, the winds, the moisture, etcetera. And those wind measurements are what we use to understand how intense the hurricane is.\n\nTornadoes pose a challenge with this type of technique because they’re very small. They’re also very intense, and they’re very difficult to predict. And oftentimes they don’t occur anywhere where we could even put an instrument in it in the first place. So the best way we have available to us to determine how intense tornadoes are is looking at how much damage is caused by the tornado after the fact.\n\nA lot of people try to argue, “Well, why don’t we use radars, for example, to look at tornadoes?” And the biggest problem with radars is the distance between the radar and the tornado. Also, where the radar is actually measuring in the tornado is not at the ground—it tends to be very high. And there’s not a standard height that we can always get information at, so we cannot compare apples to apples by using radar data.\n\nWhat does a damage survey involve?\n\nWhen you actually go to perform a damage survey, the first thing we want to do is figure out where the tornado started causing damage in the first place. So you want to establish a start point, and that is typically informed—at least as kind of a first-order guess—by radar data.\n\n“I’ve seen bits of straw stuck into the concrete berms of sidewalks.” —Jana Houser, tornado researcher\n\nWe have a list of 28 damage indicators, where we have very specific types of buildings and other objects. This is going to be, like, a hospital or a house or a gas station with an awning or a hardwood tree or a softwood tree. Meteorologists have worked intimately with civil engineers and wind engineers, using wind tunnels and tornado simulators and all of this fancy stuff, to really figure out, like, “How much wind does it actually take to suck a roof off of a house?” So [the amount of damage to] each one of those objects has a wind speed category associated with it [on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale]: EF1, EF2, EF3, etcetera. We use what we know about the damage incurred to back calculate the winds. We put all the various pieces together at the end of the day, and the rating assigned to a tornado is based on the most intense damage across the entire path of the tornado.\n\nCan you tell us about some of your experiences with damage surveys?\n\nI’ve seen some interesting and kind of frankly gruesome things with these. I think some of the most memorable moments were after the Greensburg, Kan., tornado in May 2007. That was the very first EF5 tornado of the whole new EF scale that happened in 2007 [when it replaced the former Fujita scale].\n\nThat was my first real experience with catastrophic tornado damage. The town was just leveled—like, 90 percent of the town just was wiped off the map. There were buildings where the slabs were just basically bare. There was a fire hydrant—I will never forget this—this fire hydrant was literally sucked out of the ground with, I don’t know, at least six feet of pipe. And nothing was bent—it was, like, perfectly straight. That just speaks to the intensity of the vertical winds that happen. You don’t just have horizontal winds in a tornado.\n\nAnd I’ve seen road scouring—this is when the tornado basically sucks pavement up off of roads. And I’ve seen bits of straw stuck into the concrete berms of sidewalks. When you make that into a projectile that’s moving 200-plus miles per hour, it has enough impact to literally stick into the side of a curb.\n\nIf meteorologists can’t get out right away to do a survey, or can’t do so at all, can they use photographs?\n\nIt all depends on the quality of the photograph and what the photographer knows or doesn’t know about damage surveys. If you have someone out there who knows what they’re looking for and is zooming in on, for example, the connections between floor joists and the foundation [which can tell them how much wind a structure should be able to withstand], you can get a pretty good feeling for the damage.\n\nThe challenge with photographs is that they’re point sources. You’re not necessarily guaranteeing full time-space coverage, unless they’re really doing thousands and thousands of pictures from different angles.\n\nAnd then, obviously, the challenge with not getting a damage survey crew out immediately is that people start cleaning up immediately, muddying the waters a little bit.\n\nHow crucial is it to always do these surveys?\n\nDamage surveys are critically important to informing our U.S. tornado climatology. If we stop having the ability to go out and actually do damage surveys consistently, that is going to throw off our whole understanding of what’s happening with tornadoes in time.\n\nWe could get a false sense that there are fewer tornadoes because we don’t have crews that are actually going out to survey some of these weaker tornadoes. Or, if offices are pressed for time, we might end up actually getting inaccurate EF scale ratings because they are short-staffed and are dealing with limited resources.\n\nThis, then, has implications on the big question that everybody wants to know, which is: How are tornadoes changing in a world of a changing climate? If we don’t have adequate data, we can’t answer that question accurately."

        "content": "The midtown Manhattan building where Jackie Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, and Truman Capote once dined, then the legendary French restaurant La Grenouille, is now a nondescript renovation site with wood, metal, and industrial-size garbage bins strewn about. The 60-year home of La Grenouille will soon be turned into the new American home of Quanjude, the most famous Peking duck restaurant brand in China. Quanjude, a publicly listed company controlled by a state-owned entity, bought the 6,800-square-foot building on 52nd Street for $14.3 million in October in an attempt to bring Chinese fine dining to America.\n\nThe 161-year-old brand's first branch in the US is going all out. The wallpaper will replicate a 12th-century Chinese handscroll painting. The private dining room will be decorated with traditional fans and chopsticks. But it is the quality of the food that Yan Zhang, the head of Quanjude America, wants diners to obsess about. \"Chinese cuisine is exquisite and profound. But in this part of the world, people think it's just spring rolls and chow mein,\" Zhang said. \"We want to revamp their cognition.\"\n\nQuanjude is one of at least 10 major Chinese food and beverage brands planning to hit US shores this year. Driven by an oversaturated market, a troubled economy back home, and the potential to be listed on the US stock market, companies serving everything from high-end dinners to dumplings and milk tea — several of them with thousands of locations in China — are now poised to break into the US food market. And dozens more are planning to study the landscape to possibly jump in themselves.\n\nBut with the relationship between the US and China at one of its rockiest points since the two countries resumed their diplomatic relationship in 1979, the Chinese newcomers' path to success is extremely precarious. Sure, they aren't working on critical technology or launching major social media platforms, but Chinese restaurants have still faced backlash in the past few years, with some Americans blaming the country for the COVID pandemic or because of a general antipathy toward the Chinese Communist Party. Is America really ready for what some local Chinese restaurant insiders are calling a Chinese food \"tsunami\"?\n\nSince the first Chinese restaurant in the US opened in 1849 in San Francisco during the gold rush, generations of blue-collar immigrants have taken advantage of the relatively low-cost entry point in the restaurant industry to make ends meet. They created dishes that are nonexistent in China, such as chop suey or General Tso's chicken, to cater to Western palettes, forming an expectation among Americans that Chinese cuisine is convenient and cheap. Chinese immigrants, meanwhile, have had to watch their cuisine sink to the bottom of their adopted country's food chain.\n\nWhen Zhang started traveling around North America for his import and export business 18 years ago, he couldn't bear the Chinese food he came across. \"Nothing is authentic other than the beef noodle,\" he said. A foodie himself, Zhang vowed to make a difference. In 2017, he reached out to Quanjude, proposing to bring the iconic restaurant to North America. He opened the first branch in Vancouver, Canada, in early 2020, right before the pandemic ravaged indoor dining. In 2022, it won a Michelin star, which it has held onto since — and Zhang expects the New York branch to get even greater plaudits.\n\n\"Chinese immigrants are better educated and wealthier now. We crave for a better presentation of our own culture,\" said Zhang. \"It is the best time for food brands in China to expand overseas.\"\n\nWhile there are some Chinese fine-dining restaurants in the US run by Chinese Americans, the new wave brings some of the best-known restaurant brands in China.\n\nThe timing is made more urgent by China's recent economic troubles. The Chinese government says the revenue of the food and beverage industry in the country increased just 5.3% in 2024, a nosedive from the 20.4% increase in 2023, and the smallest growth in a decade excluding the pandemic years. An industry report on 22 publicly listed Chinese food and beverage companies found that 68% saw their profits decline in the first half of last year. Close to 3 million restaurants and cafés in China shut down for good last year.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nTo have a store in Manhattan is like erecting a flag on the moon. It's worth it even if you don't make money.\n\nChinese food brands' moves to open overseas — which had been increasing modestly since the 1980s — have rapidly accelerated. Hongcan Industry Research Institute, a Chinese group that studies the restaurant industry, released a report in September that found more than 100 Chinese food and beverage brands have moved into more than 180 countries, now running 700,000 locations outside China — a 200,000 increase since 2016. The Chinese government has spurred on the expansion, issuing two directives last year for Chinese food and beverage brands to \"go overseas\" to help \"improve the international influence of Chinese cuisine culture.\"\n\n\"Almost all the major food and beverage brands you see in China are considering coming to the US,\" said Beichen Hu, a restaurant investor and the director of the North America Asian Food Industry Association. \"A popular catchphrase circulating broadly in the food industry in China is 'to go overseas or to die.'\"\n\nThe US market certainly looks appealing. The food service industry reached over $1 trillion in sales last year, with $1.5 trillion projected in 2025. A survey by the National Restaurant Association found that 80% of restaurant operators in the US expect their sales this year to be the same or higher than last year's. An analysis by IBISWorld predicted a promising market for Chinese restaurants in the US through 2030 as the demand for Chinese food among households with annual income above $100,000 is expected to increase.\n\nFor as much of a setback as it was, the pandemic also offered a rare opportunity. \"Many prime locations in coveted places like Manhattan are vacant after the pandemic, and that opens the market for brands from China,\" said Tom Chen, the founder of Kepler Mission Design Group, a design and branding company that's helped food and beverage chains from China open in the US. Leading Chinese brands have snatched up space in competitive areas like Fifth Avenue and Times Square in New York and Beverly Hills in Los Angeles.\n\n\"These brands don't want to be just another Chinese restaurant in the US; they want the esteem,\" said Chao Wang, the owner of the rice-noodle shop Hunan Slurp in New York's East Village. He's helping restaurants from Hunan province, where he's from, to open in the US. \"To have a store in Manhattan is like erecting a flag on the moon. It's worth it even if you don't make money.\"\n\nStill, the cuisine push from China may seem counterintuitive. The tension between the US and China, especially Washington's restrictions on Chinese tech companies in recent years, has created a palpable chilling effect. Figures on foreign investment from China vary significantly, but they all show a steep drop in Chinese investment into the US in the last several years. The most recent annual survey by the China General Chamber of Commerce — USA found that in 2023, more than 60% of Chinese companies in the US complained about the deteriorating business environment and 22% had reduced investment here.\n\nBut geopolitical risks are not top of mind for most eateries. \"The US is still a pro-business country. And we sell consumer products, not computer chips,\" said Amanda Wang, the owner of Ningji, the leading Chinese chain of lemon-based teas, with more than 3,000 stores in China. Its first overseas outlet is opening in mid-April in Los Angeles with a product line customized for American consumers called bobobaba. And the company is already looking for more locations.\n\nThis is an industry that is safe until Chinese companies start to win, and then they're not safe.\n\nWang said the biggest cultural shock for her is the time it takes to open a store in the US. Ningji decided to take over the fully functioning venue of a shuttered beverage store in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale last November, but as of early February, Wang was still waiting for the license to be approved to start the renovation. \"I am speechless,\" said Wang. \"We open a new store on average in 20 days in China.\"\n\nWang was also confused by a recent street encounter. Two days before the new year, on her way to the supermarket, a stranger yelled at her to \"go back to China,\" and blamed her for stealing jobs in the US. \"I don't understand why he thought I stole his job,\" said Wang. \"We are here to create jobs.\"\n\nThis kind of hostility isn't exactly rare. A Pew Research Center survey from May found that eight in 10 Americans have negative views about China, and a study by researchers from Boston College, the University of Michigan, and Microsoft found that Asian restaurants in the US lost $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020 because of anti-Chinese sentiment, which President Donald Trump helped stoke by calling COVID-19 the \"China virus.\"\n\n\"Trump likes to stir racial antagonism,\" Chao Wang of Hunan Slurp said. The window of a noodle shop Wang owned in Long Island City, New York, was smashed during the pandemic, and he attributed it to anti-Asian hate.\n\nYong Zhao, the cofounder and chief executive of the American food chains Junzi Kitchen and Nice Day, had a disturbing moment a few months ago with a customer at his store in Long Island. \"I told him we are going to bring organic mushrooms from a local farm into our recipes, and he said, 'Oh, is the farm owned by the CCP?'\" said Zhao. The customer was referring to the rising concern that the Chinese Communist Party is spying on the US from farmlands purchased by Chinese entities. \"If I were white, I don't think he'd have asked.\"\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBefore the pandemic, Zhao, a Yale-educated environmental scientist turned restaurateur, had formed a network of young Chinese restaurant operators in the US with a mission to \"tell the stories of Chinese cuisine.\" But he said since the trade war began in 2018, American media has much less coverage of Chinese culture and lifestyle, and Americans seem less interested in Chinese culture. \"Say, you want to highlight the history of a traditional dish from Chengdu, but many people here don't know where Chengdu is,\" said Zhao, referring to the southwestern Chinese city that is known for mapo tofu and kung pao chicken.\n\nTo some industry people I spoke with, Chinese food companies are less likely to be caught up in geopolitical wrangling than, say, the tech industry, but their biggest risk factor may be their own growth. \"This is an industry that is safe until Chinese companies start to win, and then they're not safe,\" said Chris Pereira, the founder and CEO of iMpact, a New York-based consulting firm that has helped hundreds of Chinese enterprises enter the US.\n\nBefore he founded iMpact in 2020, Pereira worked as an executive at Huawei, the Chinese tech conglomerate that was driven out of the US market over national security concerns. Having watched that play out, Pereira suggests big Chinese food chains find ways to share profits with American partners as a form of self-protection. For instance, he said, if Luckin Coffee, the Chinese coffeehouse behemoth with more than 22,000 locations in China that plans to come to the US this year, starts to steal market share from Starbucks, \"you can bet the US government will find a way to talk about national security for coffee.\"\n\nIn a crowded back office at Quanjude's Manhattan site, Zhang has a more urgent challenge. The visa applications for the five chefs he plans to bring in from China are still pending. Since US-China relations started deteriorating, it's been harder to obtain visas for Chinese nationals, but Zhang says the Chinese-trained chefs are essential for the restaurant. \"We won't allow the quality of the food to suffer under untrained hands,\" he said. If nothing else works out, he plans to bring Quanjude chefs from Canada.\n\nZhang thinks his ducks could serve an important mission. \"I believe food is the best bridge for divisions and it may help pull the US and China closer again,\" he said.\n\nAfter a pause, he continued. \"Except if there is a hot war,\" he said, \"everything Chinese in the US would be doomed.\"\n\nRong Xiaoqing is a New York-based award-winning journalist who has been writing about the Chinese community in the US since 2002."

Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days.\n\nOvernight into Sunday morning there were new tornado warnings issued in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in several counties in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee.\n\nDay after day of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach what the agency calls \"major flood stage,\" with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee.\n\nA 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky including a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said.\n\nAlso Saturday, a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided.\n\nTornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths.\n\nThere were 521 flights cancelled and more than 6,400 flights delayed within the U.S. or coming into or leaving the country on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday.\n\nInterstate commerce also could be affected. The extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nThe outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts, twice that of just a decade ago.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLouisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days.\n\n\"We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,\" he said.\n\ntoggle caption Jon Cherry/AP\n\nFlash flood threat looms over many states\n\nFlash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning.\n\nHundreds of Kentucky roads across the state were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides.\n\nDowntown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, reopened in the morning after floodwaters from the Little River receded, giving a much-needed reprieve, but still more rainfall was on its way, Mayor James R. Knight Jr. said.\n\n\"We got a little rain, but most of it went north of us,\" Knight said. \"Thank goodness on that. Gave us a little break.\"\n\nIn north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.\n\nIn Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding.\n\nBNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by floodwaters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen.\n\ntoggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nWhy so much nasty weather?\n\nSince Wednesday, more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday.\n\nForecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state's emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding.\n\nIn Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities.\n\nAmong them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage.\n\n\"I grabbed all my stuff and came here,\" said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: \"I don't leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed. I have to make sure I have them with me.\""

The amber warning also covers parts of England, Wales, and southern Scotland, reflecting growing concern as the dry spell continues with no significant rainfall in sight. In the Republic of Ireland, a Condition Orange fire warning – also the second-highest level – has been issued. The Irish government's notice warns of \"a high fire risk in all areas where hazardous fuels such as dead grasses and shrub fuels like heather and gorse exist\". It also highlights how fire behaviour can be intensified by low humidity, gusty winds, and recent fires linked to turf cutting and illegal dumping.

Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir described the blazes as having a devastating impact on the environment and wildlife. \"No one should start a fire in the countryside unless it's part of a specific planned and properly managed land management practice. \"People lighting these fires may be putting their own and others' lives at risk including the fire service personnel and other emergency services tasked to deal with them,\" he said. Five wildfires have already been reported in the Mourne Mountains in recent weeks. NI Water is warning of the long-lasting impact fires can have on both the environment and drinking water supplies. \"Wildfires don't just damage wildlife and habitats,\" said Becca Allen, Catchment Officer at NI Water. \"When a wildfire happens it also removes the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil to make its way into reservoirs which provide our drinking water. \"This requires a lot of resources to remove at the water treatment stage.

But ultimately, it’s proof of structural achievement: The buildings rock enough to send hundreds of gallons of water overboard, but in spite of their height, they are strong enough to resist the tremors. (It is the age of a building, not its height, that generally puts occupants at risk during an earthquake.)\n\nWhile this phenomenon is not brand new—quake-driven rooftop pool waterfalls have been caught on camera in Manila, Puerto Vallarta, and Taipei in recent years—it’s increasingly frequent. And not just because more people are pointing their phones at the sky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting a pool at the top of a building is a relatively recent development in the history of high-rise construction. Water is heavy (don’t fill up an inflatable pool on your roof), and when pools aren’t well-built, the damage can be enormous. There’s a reason landlords don’t want tenants to have fish tanks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a report on high-rise pools from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Chicago’s John Hancock Center was the first super-tall building to offer a swim with a view when its 44th-floor pool opened in 1969. But as recently as 2000, most of the world’s super-tall buildings (over 900 feet) did not include pools. That has changed: Since the millennium, most of them do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate A Nation of First Responders Read More\n\nSome of that reflects the engineering innovations that have allowed giant buildings to proliferate in recent decades. But it’s also a testament to the changing geography of global growth, as skyscraper construction has shifted from North America and Europe to the Gulf and East Asia. Two-thirds of the world’s super-tall buildings have been built in China and the UAE alone, and rooftop pools are obviously a more desirable amenity in warm-weather locales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the skyscrapers with rooftop pools—often flanked by cocktail bars, dance floors, or expensive restaurants—are a societal status symbol. The most famous visual landmark associated with Singapore is probably the Marina Bay Sands, with Moshe Safdie’s oblong, swimmable rooftop straddling three buildings.\n\nMost rooftop pools aren’t so easy to spot from below. And that’s part of what makes the videos from Bangkok so revelatory. Disasters pretend to be egalitarian. Ultimately, though, they expose the fissures in society, revealing the disparate experiences between those who have a well-built home, an insurance policy, or somewhere else to go—and those who do not. When water tumbles from a roof, it reveals the power of the earthquake, but also the hidden inequality of the city, provoking the sudden realization, from a lower floor or a hot street below, that those people up there can go for a swim.\n\nMeanwhile, in Myanmar, first responders are trying to find people trapped in the wreckage of collapsed structures. The grim reason it takes a long time to confirm an earthquake’s death toll is that many people, if not most, survive the initial collapse. What determines their fate is how quickly someone comes to look for them."

The second was that the sci-fi extraction shooter from ex-Blizzard developers might be able to succeed where Sony’s hero shooter did not thanks to a gameplay loop that looks way more like Sea of Thieves than Call of Duty.\n\n\n\nRanking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes\n\nRanking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes\n\nRevealed by Dreamhaven studio Moonshot Games during a Game Awards livestream on Tuesday, Wildgate is a multiplayer FPS in which crews of players explore a region of space called the Reach in search of a MacGuffin called the Artifact. Once teams find it, they have to battle one another to extract. That can happen aboard spaceships or out in the void. But if a squad’s ship gets blown up, their journey will come to an abrupt end. It’s coming to PC and consoles sometime in 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can see where I’m getting the Sea of Thieves vibes from. The deep-dive trailer makes that even more apparent:\n\nIt’s an ambitious mashup of genres. Wildgate boasts “epic spaceship battles,” exploration through “cosmic storms,” plundering alien outposts for loot, and a unique cast of adventurers called Prospectors, each with their own arsenal of tools and abilities. The world and characters, which include a cat in a fish tank controlling a mech and a anthropomorphic goat warrior, are a bit all over the place, but I can see them growing on me if the gameplay loop is as fun as it sounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether Wildgate has the magic to put it over the top where so many other live-service multiplayer games have failed remains to be seen. Moonshot Games is helmed by some Blizzard vets who worked on Hearthstone, StarCraft, and other franchises, including producer Jason Chayes, designer Dustin Browder, and artist Ben Thompson. The team is part of Dreamhaven, the publishing label led by ex-Blizzard president Mike Morhaime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Wildgate rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realizes Dreamhaven’s goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories,” Morhaime said in a press release. “Since every match of Wildgate plays differently, there’s tons for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we’re looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday’s livestream also gave updates on Dreamhaven’s other partner projects. Secret Door’s tabletop-inspired RPG, Sunderfolk, will be $50 and is headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on April 23. FuzzyBot’s Lynked: Banner of the Spark, a loot-based action-RPG cozy sim (yes, really), is headed out of Early Access for PS5, Xbox, and PC on May 22. Finally, Game River’s Mechabellum, a tactical mech auto battler with shades of Total Annihilation that launched on PC last year, recently launched season 3 and is currently on sale.\n\n.\n\n\n\n"

Per an update shared by the Myanmar authorities on Saturday, the death toll has risen above 1,600. In addition, authorities report over 3,000 people are injured, with over 100 others missing. Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, is among the hardest-hit areas, with widespread destruction. Meanwhile, in Thailand, a total of 18 people have been reported killed by the earthquake so far. 11 of those were at the site of the collapse of a high-rise building under construction. Dozens of people are said to be unaccounted for.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn Sunday, March 30, a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck near Mandalay, prompting alarm before rescue efforts continued. Read More: Photos Show Devastating Impact of Powerful Earthquake That Rocked Myanmar and Thailand Myanmar’s ruling military junta declared a state of emergency in several regions affected by the earthquake on Friday, and called for humanitarian aid in a rare show of international appeal. Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said in a statement that the earthquake “could not come at a worse time” for Myanmar, as it still reels from the 2021 military coup and subsequent displacement of masses in a civil war. “All parties to the armed conflict should be prioritizing the needs of civilians whose lives have been upended in this disaster and ensuring that they have unfettered access to aid,” Freeman said. “Human rights must be at the centre of all relief efforts, and there must be no discrimination in aid provision.”\n\nUNICEF, originally the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, has also addressed Myanmar’s precarious situation. A statement on the UNICEF USA website has called for “all parties to uphold the rights of children and ensure unhindered humanitarian access.” As the affected areas continue to recover—a process that has only just begun—countries around the globe have come out to send humanitarian aid. Here are the ways that you can help victims of the Myanmar earthquake. U.N. Crisis Relief The United Nations is calling for donations in addition to an initial allocation of $5 million from the U.N. Emergency Fund by Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher. Donations will go directly to the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund, and will “provide them with urgently needed food, water, shelter and other basic support at this critical time.” Red Cross The “Red Cross Red Crescent is working to deliver emergency relief and to get help to those impacted by the earthquake as quickly as possible.” Teams from the Myanmar Red Cross Society are also working to connect hospitals and clinics with emergency blood donations.\n\nUNICEF USA\n\nUNICEF runs disaster relief operations focused on children’s needs and has asked for donations specifically for children impacted and displaced by the earthquake. “UNICEF is on the ground in Myanmar, working with partners to meet children's needs. The earthquake is the latest blow to a country already struggling with escalating conflict and climate shocks,” the agency’s website reads.\n\nSave the Children\n\nSave the Children is an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) that works specifically to protect children at risk. They have launched a “Children’s Emergency Fund” for youths in Myanmar in need of shelter and other basic needs in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nProject HOPE\n\nProject HOPE is working to “address both urgent and long-term needs, including primary and mental health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene,” for those affected by the earthquake. The nonprofit organization has previously responded to other natural disasters by deploying humanitarian aid to places such as Morocco, Syria, Turkey, and Haiti."

        "content": "“I had four feet of water in my living room. When I got back in there, there were dead fish in my house.”\n\nThe film world has been no stranger to natural disasters the past few months — as we all know, having seen the horrific images of the Los Angeles wildfires that engulfed Pacific Palisades and Altadena this January. And Mark Famiglio is no exception.\n\nThat scene of flooding was what greeted the Sarasota Film Festival president last September when he returned to his Siesta Key home after evacuating from Hurricane Helene. In fact, his house was largely inaccessible to repair work, as his driveway had almost washed out in its entirety. As was common all over the Florida Gulf Coast, the road nearby was lined with a canyon of refrigerators and cabinets and other household items ruined by the flood waters and left out by the curb for the city to haul away. And then Hurricane Milton hit less than two weeks later.\n\nAsk anyone else involved with the Sarasota Film Festival, which draws primarily from locals to serve as volunteers, and they were likely affected too. Senior programmer Brian Gordon, who only moved to Sarasota four years ago, had his first experience of buying plywood at Home Depot and boarding up his house. “I’ll never forget the experience of Milton’s eye passing over us and it suddenly getting calm outside,” Gordon said.\n\nThousands of people across Sarasota and the broader Tampa Bay area are still displaced from Helene and Milton. Hundreds of businesses still haven’t reopened across the region, or may never reopen. But only for a moment did Famiglio, a local entrepreneur who got his start in real estate, seriously consider not holding the Sarasota Film Festival in 2025. Right away, he and his team saw that staging the 10-day festival, which kicked off April 4, was more important than ever.\n\nCan a film festival help a community rebound from a natural disaster? Sarasota is certainly going to try. And depending on the results, it could be a model for how the film community in a city ravaged by disaster can aid in its recovery.\n\nGlenn Close-starring AFI FEST premiere “The Summer Book” and Maria Schneider biopic “Being Maria” have already played to sold out crowds at the festival, now in the middle of its run. As usual, the festival kicked off with a poolside party — and its beloved street party is set for April 11. Plus, the filmmaker who’s made Florida his canvas with a neon-tinted zeal like no one else, Harmony Korine, will be receiving the Trailblazer Award in person.\n\nThough performing arts venues are back up and running, this is the biggest city-wide event set in Sarasota since Milton made landfall right over Siesta Key on October 9. “Doing what we normally do is what matters the most,” Gordon said. “After something like this, just doing what we normally do has even more impact than usual. I think people want to get out a little bit more, even more than in the past because people just want to get back to normal.”\n\nFor Gordon, who programmed for long stints at the San Francisco International Film Festival and Nashville Film Festival, and at other festivals, Sarasota is important in another respect for the specialty market. “Some of the films that we show won’t end up on the big screen again,” he said. Though Sarasota is not a sales festival, it is a place where audience sentiment for films without distribution can be noted. Added Famiglio, “Some of these filmmakers rely on this festival and they need it not just for the networking, but just to showcase their art. It’s too important not to do.”\n\nAs usual, the festival lineup features several movies from Sarasota or the broader Florida Gulf Coast region, including the opening night film, the documentary “Marcella,” about the legendary evangelist of Italian cuisine in America, Marcella Hazan. She lived in nearby Longboat Key until her death in 2013. But even some films that have nothing to do with Sarasota have taken on a new resonance for this community in recovery, such as the closing night film “Lovers,” directed by Taylor McFadden, about a group of friends picking up the pieces after one of their own took his life.\n\nThis festival, like any festival, can be an important way for the community around it to see itself. Once again, SarasotaOut.com published a Gay Guide to the Sarasota Film Festival. In a state where LGBTQ rights have been consistently under attack (despite having the third largest LGBTQ population of any state in the U.S.), this platform can be incredibly meaningful, as it was last year for the documentary “A House Is Not a Disco.”\n\n“I have people that are very close to me — family and close friends — some of the most important people in my entire life, that are wrestling with these sorts of issues and confronted with, ‘Do we have to run from Florida? Can we not come to Florida? Do we have to leave? Are we moving to Canada?,’” Famiglio said. “I deal with this constantly, almost daily. And I don’t know, we got to do something. And with the film festival, I think film as a form of expression is an important way where you can convince and persuade people and keep things on the menu without pushing it into people’s faces.”\n\nFamiglio is all about having dialogues. The day after our phone interview in mid-March, he was going to have lunch with Governor Ron DeSantis and participate in a roundtable with the governor, who dramatically cut almost all public funding for the arts across Florida in 2024, including grants for the Sarasota Film Festival. You can’t address the problem if you don’t engage in conversation, right?\n\n“Honestly, everything that was going on when California got slammed with the wildfires, propelled us to do this year’s festival even more,” Famiglio said. This is an opportunity to show that film can truly be a thing that brings a community together. Film can be a catalyst for conversations that need to happen. And it can be a much needed escape, a bit of fun for a community that really needs it."
