        "content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAs California recovers from devastating wildfires and hurricane season fast approaches, President Donald Trump and the White House DOGE team are slashing the workforce at the federal agency responsible for monitoring extreme weather.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to more than a dozen current and former employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who said that staff and policy changes were making their day-to-day jobs more challenging. They worried about how the upheaval would affect Americans' safety — especially as hurricane and tornado seasons rapidly approach.\n\nAndrew Hazelton, a former NOAA hurricane modeler who was fired in February alongside other probationary employees, was blunt: If forecasts and hurricane warnings go downhill, he told BI, \"we could see loss of life as a result.\"\n\nThe agency's reach extends across the country and the globe. Besides its work on extreme climate conditions, NOAA provides the data that powers the weather app on your phone, alerts pilots to turbulence, and helps farmers know when to plant to keep American agriculture rolling.\n\n\"It really, truly affects every single American every day,\" a former probationary employee said. (Some employees we spoke to asked to remain anonymous.)\n\nBefore Trump took office in January, NOAA employed around 12,430 people, according to a congressional report. More than 1,000 employees have departed through layoffs or buyouts, said JoAnn Becker, the president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization, a union representing NOAA employees. More than 600 were terminated in February and about 500 took the administration's buyout offer, according to previous reporting.\n\nBetween the uncertain future for probationary employees, voluntary early retirements and buyouts, and Trump's ongoing government-wide reduction-in-force effort, the agency may shrink further.\n\n\"We would like to just go on and do our jobs and save people's lives,\" an employee at the National Weather Service, a department within NOAA, said.\n\nOutside of staffing cuts, some employees said stricter rules around travel and expense budgets have made it difficult to do the jobs that are vital to protecting people from natural disasters. Expiration dates for contracts marked as \"urgent\" are also coming up soon, according to internal documents viewed by BI.\n\nAn \"extensive process was conducted to ensure that mission-critical functions to fulfill NOAA's statutory responsibilities weren't compromised,\" a Trump administration spokesperson told BI in a statement. The spokesperson declined to provide additional details about the process.\n\nSusan Buchanan, a NOAA spokeswoman, said that the agency remains dedicated to its mission. A spokesperson for the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA, did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\n\nFor those who remain, the show must go on, even as resources and staff dwindle.\n\n\"We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people,\" a NOAA employee said. \"Eventually one of them is probably going to fall.\"\n\nAviation at risk\n\nSeveral people who spoke to BI expressed unease over how the staffing cuts and operational changes at NOAA could affect the aviation industry.\n\nThough flying remains the safest mode of transportation, a National Weather Service employee who's worked at the agency for more than a decade said that if the turmoil at the agency continues long term, \"I don't know if I'd trust getting on a plane.\"\n\nNOAA assists with running aviation-specific weather models for pilots, helping them track things like turbulence. Its data \"ripples right through the whole system,\" Brad Colman, the former president of the American Meteorological Society, said.\n\n\"If systems are degraded, a turbulence forecast may go down in quality, and uncertainty is increased,\" Colman said. \"There's more exposure, more risk.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Airline Dispatchers Federation told BI in an email that NOAA provides dispatchers with \"essential tools,\" including turbulence, wind, and weather forecasts.\n\n\"Virtually all\" of the weather data for domestic flights comes from NOAA, and its data is \"fundamental\" to daily operations, the spokesperson said. The organization hasn't yet noticed operational impacts but warned that \"even subtle degradations could affect our operations.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeteorologists who work for airlines receive foundational data from NOAA to develop their forecasts, the spokesperson added, noting that smaller airlines will likely face more challenges if NOAA's data degrades — potentially creating a disparity in safety across the industry.\n\nOr as Tom Di Liberto, a former public affairs official and climate scientist who was fired in February, put it: \"There's a reason why a lot of weather forecast offices are close by or at a major airport.\"\n\nLess reliable forecasts\n\nStaffers affected by the terminations weren't just at NOAA's headquarters in Maryland; they were stationed in regional offices across the country.\n\nOne office in Alaska stopped launching daily weather balloons to collect data for forecasts, Larry Hubble, an upper air program manager in the state, said. On March 20, the National Weather Service temporarily suspended weather balloon launches at offices in Nebraska and South Dakota, while seven other sites are scaling back to one launch a day instead of two because of staffing shortages.\n\nOther instruments, like radars on commercial aircraft and satellites, also collect data. The NWS employee of more than a decade said that balloons are one of the most accurate methods of weather measurement, and if they're scaled back, \"they're going to start seeing the degradation of the models and the forecast is going to lose its accuracy.\"\n\n\"If you degrade our capabilities, our warnings get weaker and people and property get compromised,\" a NOAA employee told BI. \"Damages are going to increase, people are not going to get out of harm's way, and they're going to die.\"\n\nThe Government and Accountability Office said in a March report that staffing shortages and aircraft maintenance problems in recent years had already hampered hurricane hunters' ability to perform their jobs — well before DOGE ever came knocking on doors.\n\nThe private sector depends on NOAA\n\nThe changes at NOAA will likely ripple across the private sector, affecting a range of industries, some employees told BI. The reinsurance industry, for example, uses NOAA data to help confirm damages from natural disasters and dole out funds. Construction workers rely on NOAA data to figure out where to build new projects.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nThe economic implications are vast — NOAA's products impact more than one-third of the country's GDP, according to the agency's website.\n\n\"If you take out NOAA, the private sector cannot do what NOAA does,\" Di Liberto said. The agency operates thousands of weather balloons, hundreds of buoys, 10 airplanes, and 18 satellites and makes that information accessible to the entire public — not just those who can pay for it.\n\nThe spokesperson from the Airline Dispatchers Federation said that private weather companies provide helpful supplemental services, but they ultimately rely on NOAA's raw data.\n\n\"There is simply no replacement for NOAA's comprehensive data collection infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Juliana Kaplan.\n\nHave a tip?

Made up of 15 UK aid agencies, including the British Red Cross, Oxfam and Save the Children, the DEC is asking the British public for donations before the monsoon season arrives in two months. More than 2,800 people have died and more than 4,500 have been injured, according to the leaders of Myanmar's military government, with figures expected to rise. The charities say shelter, medicine, food, water and cash support is \"urgently needed\".\n\nBaroness Chapman, minister for development, said public donations to the DEC appeal would be matched pound-for-pound by the government, up to the value of £5m. DEC's chief executive Saleh Saeed said the situation was \"ever more critical.\" \"Funds are urgently needed to help families access life-saving humanitarian aid following this catastrophe,\" he said. Multiple international aid agencies and foreign governments have dispatched personnel and supplies to quake-hit regions.\n\nMyanmar was already facing a severe humanitarian crisis before the 7.7 magnitude earthquake due to the ongoing civil war there, with the DEC estimating a third of the population is in need of aid. The country has been gripped by violence amid the conflict between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country. On Wednesday, Myanmar's military government announced a temporary ceasefire lasting until 22 April, saying it was aimed at expediting relief and reconstruction efforts. Rebel groups had already unilaterally declared a ceasefire to support relief efforts earlier this week, but the military had refused to do the same until Wednesday's announcement. Aid workers have come under attack in Myanmar. On Tuesday night, the army opened fire at a Chinese Red Cross convoy carrying earthquake relief supplies. Nine of the charity's vehicles came under attack. The UN and some charities have accused the military junta of blocking access.\n\nReuters Aid is being sent from across the globe to help disaster-stricken communities\n\nArete/DEC Mandalay city was near the epicentre of the magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck on Friday"

Samurai, merchants, and villagers wrote of minor flooding and damage. Some noted that no parent earthquake had been felt; they were wondering what had set off the waves. They had no way knowing that the tsunami had been spawned during an earthquake along the coast of northwestern North America. This orphan tsunami would not be linked to its parent earthquake until the middle 1990s, through an extraordinary series of discoveries in both North America and Japan.\n\nThe Orphan Tsunami of 1700, now in its second edition, tells this scientific detective story through its North American and Japanese clues. The discoveries underpin many of today’s precautions against earthquakes and tsunamis in the Cascadia region of northwestern North America. The Japanese tsunami of March 2011 called attention to those hazards as a mirror image of the transpacific waves of January 1700."

But now there is little left except a pile of bricks, concrete and iron rods. The school says 12 children and a teacher died, but locals believe the number is at least 40 - that is how many were in the downstairs section that collapsed. Residents and parents are distraught.

There were six military medical trucks and several tents outside, where patients evacuated from the hospital were being cared for. The tents were being sprayed with water to give those inside some relief from the intense heat. It looked like there were about 200 injured people there, some with bloodied heads, others with broken limbs. We saw an official angrily reprimanding staff about other colleagues who had not turned up to work during the emergency. I realised the man was the minister for health, Dr Thet Khaing Win, and approached him for an interview but he curtly rejected my request."

        "content": "What caused the Myanmar earthquake - and why did it make a tower in Bangkok collapse?\n\n31 March 2025 Share Save Esme Stallard Climate and science reporter, BBC News Vicky Wong BBC News Share Save\n\nMoment Bangkok high-rise collapses following Myanmar earthquake\n\nA major earthquake in Myanmar on Friday has caused more than 3,000 deaths and led to the collapse of numerous structures. Even though the south-east Asian nation is a high risk region for earthquakes, neighbouring Thailand and China - which were also affected by the quake - are not. The Thai capital, Bangkok, sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) from the epicentre of Friday's earthquake - and yet an unfinished high-rise building in the city was felled by it. Here we will explain what caused this earthquake, and how it was able to have such a powerful effect so far away.\n\nWhat caused the earthquake?\n\nThe earth's upper layer is split into different sections, called tectonic plates, which are all moving constantly. Some move alongside each other, whilst others are above and below each other. It is this movement that causes earthquakes and volcanoes. Myanmar is considered to be one of the most geologically \"active\" areas in the world because it sits on top of the convergence of four of these tectonic plates - the Eurasian plate, the Indian plate, the Sunda plate and the Burma microplate. The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate, and the 2004 Tsunami as a result of the Indian plate moving beneath the Burma microplate. Dr Rebecca Bell, a reader in tectonics at Imperial College London, said that to accommodate all of this motion, faults - cracks in the rock - form which allow tectonic plates to \"slither\" sideways. There is a major fault called the Sagaing fault, which cuts right through Myanmar north to south and is more than 1,200km (746 miles) long. Early data suggests that the movement that caused Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake was a \"strike-slip\" - where two blocks move horizontally along each other. This aligns with the movement typical of the Sagaing fault. As the plates move past each other, they can become stuck, building friction until it is suddenly released and the earth shifts, causing an earthquake.\n\nWhy was the earthquake felt so far away?\n\nEarthquakes can happen at up to 700km (435 miles) below the surface. This one was just 10km from the surface, making it very shallow. This increases the amount of shaking at the surface. The earthquake was also very large - measuring 7.7 on the moment scale. It produced more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey. The size of the quake was because of the type of fault, said Dr Bell. \"The straight nature [of the fault] means earthquakes can rupture over large areas - and the larger the area of the fault that slips, the larger the earthquake,\" she explained. \"There have been six magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in this region in the last century.\" This straight fault also means a lot of the energy can be carried down its length - which extends for 1,200km south towards Thailand. When it comes to why the earth shook so much, scientists believe it is because the quake was a rare \"super shear\" - meaning energy from the rupture in the earth's crust built up because it was moving faster than seismic waves can travel through the earth. Seismologist Prof Frederik Tilmann, from the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences in Germany, explained in analysis shared online that the rupture travelled at a speed of about 5km per second - making it \"the earthquake equivalent of a supersonic jet\". Because the fracture \"unzipped\" towards the south, it also directed this piled up energy towards the Thai capital, Bangkok, and this is why the earthquake had such an impact so far away. How earthquakes are felt at the surface is also determined by the type of soil. In soft soil - which is what Bangkok is built on - seismic waves (the vibrations of the earth) slow down and build up, getting bigger in size. So, Bangkok's geology would have made the ground shaking more intense.\n\nWhy did just one skyscraper collapse in Bangkok?\n\nWhile dramatic footage has emerged of high-rise buildings in Bangkok swaying during the quake - knocking water from rooftop pools - the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office Bangkok's Chatuchak district appears to be the only skyscraper to collapse. Prior to 2009, Bangkok did not have a comprehensive safety standard for constructing buildings to withstand earthquakes, according to Dr Christian Málaga-Chuquitaype, a senior lecturer in earthquake engineering at Imperial College London. This means that older buildings would have been particularly vulnerable. This is not unusual, as earthquake-resistant buildings can be more expensive to construct and Thailand, unlike Myanmar, does not frequently experience earthquakes. Dr Emily So, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Cambridge, noted that older buildings can and have been strengthened, such as in California, western Canada and New Zealand.\n\nWatch: Dashcam captures moment Bangkok building collapses\n\nProf Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, said that while there were regulations in 43 provinces on earthquake-proofing buildings, less than 10% of buildings are estimated to be quake-resistant. Yet the building that collapsed was new - in fact, it was still under construction when the earthquake hit - and the updated building standards would have applied. Dr Pimarnmas said Bangkok's soft soil may have also played a part in its collapse, as it can amplify ground motions three or four times over. He added: \"However, there are other assumptions such as material (concrete and reinforcements) quality and some irregularity in [the] structural system. These remain to be investigated in detail.\" Having studied the video, Dr Málaga-Chuquitaype said it appears a \"flat slab\" construction process was being favoured - which is no longer recommended in earthquake-prone areas. \"A 'flat slab' system is a way of constructing buildings where floors are made to rest directly on columns, without using beams,\" he explained. \"Imagine a table supported only by legs, with no extra horizontal supports underneath. \"While this design has cost and architectural advantages, is performs poorly during earthquakes, often failing in a brittle and sudden (almost explosive) manner.\"\n\nWhat about the buildings in Myanmar?"

        "content": "Dry conditions, wind and trees downed by Hurricane Helene fueled wildfires in North Carolina and South Carolina, where evacuation orders were in effect Tuesday. Many people in the area are still getting over the hurricane that hit in September, according to North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Bo Dossett. “A lot of the damage and the blowdown, the downed trees from Hurricane Helene are contributing to the difficulties that our firefighters are facing trying to contain this fire and so that has just been kind of one ongoing crisis from September all through into the spring for a lot of these residents,” Dossett said. “This is one more thing that they’re having to deal with on top of what they experienced back in the fall.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for parts of the South Carolina Upstate, western North Carolina and northeast Georgia through Tuesday night, as conditions were expected to be favorable for the rapid spread of wildfire with lingering dry air and winds picking up to 10 to 20 mph (16 to 32 kph) and gusting 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph). Mandatory evacuations were in effect for 146 properties in rural Polk County on Tuesday, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte, North Carolina, according to county spokesperson Kellie Cannon. Three fires there have burned at least 9.6 square miles (25 square kilometers) in that county and in neighboring Henderson County as of Tuesday, and the two larger fires are uncontained, according to the forest service. Officials released maps Tuesday that show evacuation zones in the two counties. The Black Cove Fire is one of the larger blazes. Officials said a downed power line sparked that fire, but the causes of the other two fires are under investigation.\n\nHenderson County has issued voluntary evacuation orders and opened an emergency shelter. Volunteer fire departments were on standby, Henderson County spokesperson Mike Morgan told WLOS-TV. “Especially near some of the homes where if the fire did jump, we can be there to help protect those homes,” Morgan said. “We’re here to monitor the situation very closely.” Two fires were burning in the mountains of South Carolina. The fires in Table Rock State Park and nearby Persimmon Ridge have burned a combined 2.3 square miles (5.9 square kilometers), the South Carolina Forestry Commission said. Officials said both fires were ignited by human activity and neither were contained as of Monday night. No injuries were reported, and no structures were imminently threatened as of Monday night, but voluntary evacuations were issued for about 100 homes over the weekend. On Tuesday morning, the forestry commission updated an earlier announcement to say no evacuations were planned near the Persimmon Ridge Fire, but residents were urged to be prepared to leave their homes if an evacuation is suggested in the future.\n\n“The weather over the next few days remains concerning, as relative humidities are expected to remain very low, and the forecasted wind speeds will still be conducive to spreading the fire,” the forestry commission said.\n\nDry weather and millions of trees knocked down by Hurricane Helene last year are creating a long and active fire season in the Carolinas, according to North Carolina State University forestry and environmental resources professor Robert Scheller. Scheller predicted this busy fire season if the region saw dry weather after the hurricane.\n\n“Helene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,” Scheller said. “Then these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.”\n\nDespite recent rain, most of the Carolinas are abnormally dry or experiencing a moderate drought, according to federal monitors."

Relief efforts are focused on Myanmar, where the estimated death toll rose to 1,644 by Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe number of dead from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake is expected to increase, while the number of injured was at 3,408 and the missing figure rose was 139 on Sunday. The earthquake's epicenter was near Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city with 1.5 million people. In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17.\n\nWhile food, medicine and other vital supplies have reached Myanmar, a report issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said rescue efforts have been hampered by a severe shortage of medical supplies including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicine and tents to house health workers.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,\" said Mohammed Riyas, the IRC's Myanmar director.\n\nHere is a look at some of the contributions in supplies, personnel and monetary support and the nations and groups providing assistance:\n\n\n\nDirect assistance by nations\n\nOn Sunday, a convoy of 17 Chinese cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies was expected to reach Mandalay. China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits, generators, earthquake detectors and drones while pledging around $13.8 million in emergency aid.\n\nHong Kong on Saturday dispatched 51 search-and-rescue personnel including firefighters and ambulance personnel as well as two search-and-rescue dogs. The group brought 9 tons (18,000 pounds) of equipment including life detectors and an automatic satellite tracking antenna system, according to a statement on the Hong Kong government's website. The Hong Kong government also will set aside HK$30 million ($3.9 million) from its Disaster Relief Fund to help Myanmar victims.\n\nRussia's Emergencies Ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies to Yangon, Myanmar's second-largest city, and Russia's Health Ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team that includes specialists in infectious diseases, resuscitation, traumatology and psychology, as well as search and rescue teams with canine units and devices that can search in rubble with depths as much as 4.5 meters (14.7 feet).\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTwo Indian C-17 military transport aircraft on Saturday brought in a field hospital unit and some 120 personnel who traveled north to Mandalay to establish a 60-bed emergency treatment center, the country's Foreign Ministry said.

But most teams were finding only bodies.\n\nThe quake hit midday Friday, toppling thousands of buildings, collapsing bridges and buckling roads. The death toll rose to 3,003 on Wednesday, with more than 4,500 people injured, MRTV reported.

And that's not guaranteed,\" Morgans said.\n\nMilitary leader due in Thailand\n\nThe military government was particularly vulnerable to bad publicity this week because its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was expected for a high-profile visit to a regional conference in the Thai capital Thursday.\n\nIt will be his first to a country other than his government's main supporters and backers — China, Russia and Russia ally Belarus — since he attended another regional meeting in Indonesia in 2021.\n\nMin Aung Hlaing and other senior leaders are shunned and sanctioned by many Western countries for their 2021 takeover and human rights abuses as they try to crush the resistance to their rule.\n\nClaims of an attack on a Chinese Red Cross convoy\n\nBefore Wednesday's ceasefire announcement, an opposition militia belonging to the Brotherhood Alliance reported that the military fired on a relief convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross vehicles late Tuesday in the northern part of Shan state.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Ta'ang National Liberation Army said that the Chinese Red Cross was bringing supplies to Mandalay and had reported its route to the military.\n\nBut Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the military government, said that the convoy hadn't notified authorities of its route ahead of time, MRTV reported. While not mentioning the Red Cross, he said that security forces had fired into the air to deter a convoy that refused to stop.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun didn't comment on the attack. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was looking into the matter.\n\nMore international aid heads to Myanmar\n\nCountries have pledged millions in assistance to help Myanmar and humanitarian aid organizations with the monumental task ahead, while also sending in specialist search and rescue teams and setting up field hospitals.\n\nIndia and China, both neighbors of Myanmar that compete for influence there, have been especially quick and generous with assistance. Multiple other countries have sent teams, including Turkey, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia.\n\ntoggle caption Cai Yang/Xinhua via AP\n\nThe U.S. government has pledged $2 million in emergency aid and sent a three-person team to assess how best to respond given drastic cuts to U.S. foreign assistance.\n\nUnited Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that continuing aftershocks are complicating humanitarian response efforts. In Mandalay City, many people are completely cut off from electricity and running water.\n\n\"People affected continue to need urgent healthcare and medical supplies, safe drinking water, food and other critical items,\" Dujarric said. \"Tents and temporary shelter are needed, as well as latrines and other hygiene items, to prevent disease outbreaks.\"\n\nExtent of devastation is still unclear\n\nMost of the details so far have come from Mandalay, which was near the epicenter of the earthquake, and Naypyitaw, about 270 kilometers (165 miles) north of Mandalay.\n\nMany areas are without power, telephone or cellphone connections, and difficult to reach by road, but more reports are beginning to trickle in.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn Singu township, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Mandalay, 27 gold miners were killed in a cave-in, the independent Democratic Voice of Burma reported.\n\nIn the area of Inle Lake, a popular tourist destination northeast of the capital, many people died when homes built on wooden stilts in the water collapsed in the earthquake, the Global New Light of Myanmar reported."

        "content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Parts of the South and Midwest, still reeling from violent storms, tornadoes and flooding that have killed more than a dozen people, face new flooding and tornado warnings that forecasters said could last for days. Severe thunderstorms have swept through a swath of the country with a population of 2.3 million people from northeast Texas through Arkansas and into southeast Missouri. Read More: How to Best Prepare For a Storm, According to the Experts\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat has happened? In Kentucky, more than 500 roads were closed by Sunday because of the floods and mudslides. Two people were killed, including a 9-year-old boy who was swept away as he walked to a school bus stop. The downtown area of Hopkinsville, Kentucky — a city of 31,000 residents 72 miles (116 kilometers) northwest of Nashville, Tennessee — was submerged. The first wave of storms killed at least five people in Tennessee and one each in Missouri and Indiana on Wednesday and Thursday. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee called the devastation in his state “enormous” and said it was too early to know whether there were more deaths as searches continued. There was massive destruction in Lake City in eastern Arkansas, where homes were flattened and cars were flipped and tossed into trees. More than 300 tornado warnings were issued by the National Weather Service since the tornado outbreak began early Wednesday, and new warnings followed overnight in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. The number of tornado warnings eclipsed those issued during last month’s deadly outbreak in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and other states.\n\nNot all tornado warnings involve an actual tornado, and it was too early to know how many were actually produced by the current outbreak. The severe weather also caused travel headaches. Hundreds of flights have been canceled and more than 6,400 flights delayed, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. The flooding also led to road closures in Kentucky and southern Illinois, among other places. The severe weather hit at a time when nearly half the National Weather Service's forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates — twice that of a decade ago — according to data obtained by The Associated Press. What's causing this wave of storms? Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. The prolonged deluge, which could dump more than a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over a four-day period, “is an event that happens once in a generation to once in a lifetime,” the National Weather Service said.\n\nWhat's next? Private forecasting company AccuWeather said northeastern Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois, western Kentucky and northwestern Tennessee needed to prepare for a catastrophic risk from flash flooding. “This is a rare and dangerous atmospheric setup,” said Jonathan Porter, AccuWeather chief meteorologist. Forecasters have also warned of major disruptions to shipping and supply chains. Shipping giant FedEx, for example, has a massive facility in the danger area, in Memphis Tennessee. Barge transportation on the lower Mississippi River could also be affected. Water rescue teams and sandbags were being set up across the region in anticipation of flooding, and authorities warned people to take the threat of rising water seriously and to not drive through water. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said flooding had reached record levels in many communities. “Kentuckians and communities have been affected across the state, and teams are working around the clock to support them,” he said Sunday on social media platform X.\n\n—Associated Press writers George Walker IV in Selmer, Tennessee; John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee; Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, Seth Borenstein in Washington; Bruce Schreiner in Shelbyville, Kentucky; and Sophia Tareen in Chicago, contributed."

        "content": "Damage surveys provide crucial information about when, where and how strong U.S. tornadoes are to better understand disaster risk\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service forecasts tornado outbreaks—often days in advance—and issues the watches and warnings that help people know when and how to prepare and when to take cover. NWS researchers also perform another task that is less recognized but crucial: conducting damage surveys in the wake of tornadoes such as those that struck parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana this week.\n\nTo learn more about why these surveys of the devastation wrought by tornadoes is so important, Scientific American spoke with tornado researcher Jana Houser of the Ohio State University.\n\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nWhy do researchers conduct damage surveys after a tornado hits?\n\nThe biggest reason is to develop a climatological database for when tornadoes are occurring, where tornadoes are occurring and how intense tornadoes are.\n\nWith a hurricane, you send a hurricane hunter aircraft in the air, and it drops an instrument package called a dropsonde through the hurricane. That instrument, as it is descending, acquires information about the temperature, the pressure, the winds, the moisture, etcetera. And those wind measurements are what we use to understand how intense the hurricane is.\n\nTornadoes pose a challenge with this type of technique because they’re very small. They’re also very intense, and they’re very difficult to predict. And oftentimes they don’t occur anywhere where we could even put an instrument in it in the first place. So the best way we have available to us to determine how intense tornadoes are is looking at how much damage is caused by the tornado after the fact.\n\nA lot of people try to argue, “Well, why don’t we use radars, for example, to look at tornadoes?” And the biggest problem with radars is the distance between the radar and the tornado. Also, where the radar is actually measuring in the tornado is not at the ground—it tends to be very high. And there’s not a standard height that we can always get information at, so we cannot compare apples to apples by using radar data.\n\nWhat does a damage survey involve?\n\nWhen you actually go to perform a damage survey, the first thing we want to do is figure out where the tornado started causing damage in the first place. So you want to establish a start point, and that is typically informed—at least as kind of a first-order guess—by radar data.\n\n“I’ve seen bits of straw stuck into the concrete berms of sidewalks.” —Jana Houser, tornado researcher\n\nWe have a list of 28 damage indicators, where we have very specific types of buildings and other objects. This is going to be, like, a hospital or a house or a gas station with an awning or a hardwood tree or a softwood tree. Meteorologists have worked intimately with civil engineers and wind engineers, using wind tunnels and tornado simulators and all of this fancy stuff, to really figure out, like, “How much wind does it actually take to suck a roof off of a house?” So [the amount of damage to] each one of those objects has a wind speed category associated with it [on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale]: EF1, EF2, EF3, etcetera. We use what we know about the damage incurred to back calculate the winds. We put all the various pieces together at the end of the day, and the rating assigned to a tornado is based on the most intense damage across the entire path of the tornado.\n\nCan you tell us about some of your experiences with damage surveys?\n\nI’ve seen some interesting and kind of frankly gruesome things with these. I think some of the most memorable moments were after the Greensburg, Kan., tornado in May 2007. That was the very first EF5 tornado of the whole new EF scale that happened in 2007 [when it replaced the former Fujita scale].\n\nThat was my first real experience with catastrophic tornado damage. The town was just leveled—like, 90 percent of the town just was wiped off the map. There were buildings where the slabs were just basically bare. There was a fire hydrant—I will never forget this—this fire hydrant was literally sucked out of the ground with, I don’t know, at least six feet of pipe. And nothing was bent—it was, like, perfectly straight. That just speaks to the intensity of the vertical winds that happen. You don’t just have horizontal winds in a tornado.\n\nAnd I’ve seen road scouring—this is when the tornado basically sucks pavement up off of roads. And I’ve seen bits of straw stuck into the concrete berms of sidewalks. When you make that into a projectile that’s moving 200-plus miles per hour, it has enough impact to literally stick into the side of a curb.\n\nIf meteorologists can’t get out right away to do a survey, or can’t do so at all, can they use photographs?\n\nIt all depends on the quality of the photograph and what the photographer knows or doesn’t know about damage surveys. If you have someone out there who knows what they’re looking for and is zooming in on, for example, the connections between floor joists and the foundation [which can tell them how much wind a structure should be able to withstand], you can get a pretty good feeling for the damage.\n\nThe challenge with photographs is that they’re point sources. You’re not necessarily guaranteeing full time-space coverage, unless they’re really doing thousands and thousands of pictures from different angles.\n\nAnd then, obviously, the challenge with not getting a damage survey crew out immediately is that people start cleaning up immediately, muddying the waters a little bit.\n\nHow crucial is it to always do these surveys?\n\nDamage surveys are critically important to informing our U.S. tornado climatology. If we stop having the ability to go out and actually do damage surveys consistently, that is going to throw off our whole understanding of what’s happening with tornadoes in time.\n\nWe could get a false sense that there are fewer tornadoes because we don’t have crews that are actually going out to survey some of these weaker tornadoes. Or, if offices are pressed for time, we might end up actually getting inaccurate EF scale ratings because they are short-staffed and are dealing with limited resources.\n\nThis, then, has implications on the big question that everybody wants to know, which is: How are tornadoes changing in a world of a changing climate? If we don’t have adequate data, we can’t answer that question accurately."

        "content": "The midtown Manhattan building where Jackie Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, and Truman Capote once dined, then the legendary French restaurant La Grenouille, is now a nondescript renovation site with wood, metal, and industrial-size garbage bins strewn about. The 60-year home of La Grenouille will soon be turned into the new American home of Quanjude, the most famous Peking duck restaurant brand in China. Quanjude, a publicly listed company controlled by a state-owned entity, bought the 6,800-square-foot building on 52nd Street for $14.3 million in October in an attempt to bring Chinese fine dining to America.\n\nThe 161-year-old brand's first branch in the US is going all out. The wallpaper will replicate a 12th-century Chinese handscroll painting. The private dining room will be decorated with traditional fans and chopsticks. But it is the quality of the food that Yan Zhang, the head of Quanjude America, wants diners to obsess about. \"Chinese cuisine is exquisite and profound. But in this part of the world, people think it's just spring rolls and chow mein,\" Zhang said. \"We want to revamp their cognition.\"\n\nQuanjude is one of at least 10 major Chinese food and beverage brands planning to hit US shores this year. Driven by an oversaturated market, a troubled economy back home, and the potential to be listed on the US stock market, companies serving everything from high-end dinners to dumplings and milk tea — several of them with thousands of locations in China — are now poised to break into the US food market. And dozens more are planning to study the landscape to possibly jump in themselves.\n\nBut with the relationship between the US and China at one of its rockiest points since the two countries resumed their diplomatic relationship in 1979, the Chinese newcomers' path to success is extremely precarious. Sure, they aren't working on critical technology or launching major social media platforms, but Chinese restaurants have still faced backlash in the past few years, with some Americans blaming the country for the COVID pandemic or because of a general antipathy toward the Chinese Communist Party. Is America really ready for what some local Chinese restaurant insiders are calling a Chinese food \"tsunami\"?\n\nSince the first Chinese restaurant in the US opened in 1849 in San Francisco during the gold rush, generations of blue-collar immigrants have taken advantage of the relatively low-cost entry point in the restaurant industry to make ends meet. They created dishes that are nonexistent in China, such as chop suey or General Tso's chicken, to cater to Western palettes, forming an expectation among Americans that Chinese cuisine is convenient and cheap. Chinese immigrants, meanwhile, have had to watch their cuisine sink to the bottom of their adopted country's food chain.\n\nWhen Zhang started traveling around North America for his import and export business 18 years ago, he couldn't bear the Chinese food he came across. \"Nothing is authentic other than the beef noodle,\" he said. A foodie himself, Zhang vowed to make a difference. In 2017, he reached out to Quanjude, proposing to bring the iconic restaurant to North America. He opened the first branch in Vancouver, Canada, in early 2020, right before the pandemic ravaged indoor dining. In 2022, it won a Michelin star, which it has held onto since — and Zhang expects the New York branch to get even greater plaudits.\n\n\"Chinese immigrants are better educated and wealthier now. We crave for a better presentation of our own culture,\" said Zhang. \"It is the best time for food brands in China to expand overseas.\"\n\nWhile there are some Chinese fine-dining restaurants in the US run by Chinese Americans, the new wave brings some of the best-known restaurant brands in China.\n\nThe timing is made more urgent by China's recent economic troubles. The Chinese government says the revenue of the food and beverage industry in the country increased just 5.3% in 2024, a nosedive from the 20.4% increase in 2023, and the smallest growth in a decade excluding the pandemic years. An industry report on 22 publicly listed Chinese food and beverage companies found that 68% saw their profits decline in the first half of last year. Close to 3 million restaurants and cafés in China shut down for good last year.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nTo have a store in Manhattan is like erecting a flag on the moon. It's worth it even if you don't make money.\n\nChinese food brands' moves to open overseas — which had been increasing modestly since the 1980s — have rapidly accelerated. Hongcan Industry Research Institute, a Chinese group that studies the restaurant industry, released a report in September that found more than 100 Chinese food and beverage brands have moved into more than 180 countries, now running 700,000 locations outside China — a 200,000 increase since 2016. The Chinese government has spurred on the expansion, issuing two directives last year for Chinese food and beverage brands to \"go overseas\" to help \"improve the international influence of Chinese cuisine culture.\"\n\n\"Almost all the major food and beverage brands you see in China are considering coming to the US,\" said Beichen Hu, a restaurant investor and the director of the North America Asian Food Industry Association. \"A popular catchphrase circulating broadly in the food industry in China is 'to go overseas or to die.'\"\n\nThe US market certainly looks appealing. The food service industry reached over $1 trillion in sales last year, with $1.5 trillion projected in 2025. A survey by the National Restaurant Association found that 80% of restaurant operators in the US expect their sales this year to be the same or higher than last year's. An analysis by IBISWorld predicted a promising market for Chinese restaurants in the US through 2030 as the demand for Chinese food among households with annual income above $100,000 is expected to increase.\n\nFor as much of a setback as it was, the pandemic also offered a rare opportunity. \"Many prime locations in coveted places like Manhattan are vacant after the pandemic, and that opens the market for brands from China,\" said Tom Chen, the founder of Kepler Mission Design Group, a design and branding company that's helped food and beverage chains from China open in the US. Leading Chinese brands have snatched up space in competitive areas like Fifth Avenue and Times Square in New York and Beverly Hills in Los Angeles.\n\n\"These brands don't want to be just another Chinese restaurant in the US; they want the esteem,\" said Chao Wang, the owner of the rice-noodle shop Hunan Slurp in New York's East Village. He's helping restaurants from Hunan province, where he's from, to open in the US. \"To have a store in Manhattan is like erecting a flag on the moon. It's worth it even if you don't make money.\"\n\nStill, the cuisine push from China may seem counterintuitive. The tension between the US and China, especially Washington's restrictions on Chinese tech companies in recent years, has created a palpable chilling effect. Figures on foreign investment from China vary significantly, but they all show a steep drop in Chinese investment into the US in the last several years. The most recent annual survey by the China General Chamber of Commerce — USA found that in 2023, more than 60% of Chinese companies in the US complained about the deteriorating business environment and 22% had reduced investment here.\n\nBut geopolitical risks are not top of mind for most eateries. \"The US is still a pro-business country. And we sell consumer products, not computer chips,\" said Amanda Wang, the owner of Ningji, the leading Chinese chain of lemon-based teas, with more than 3,000 stores in China. Its first overseas outlet is opening in mid-April in Los Angeles with a product line customized for American consumers called bobobaba. And the company is already looking for more locations.\n\nThis is an industry that is safe until Chinese companies start to win, and then they're not safe.\n\nWang said the biggest cultural shock for her is the time it takes to open a store in the US. Ningji decided to take over the fully functioning venue of a shuttered beverage store in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale last November, but as of early February, Wang was still waiting for the license to be approved to start the renovation. \"I am speechless,\" said Wang. \"We open a new store on average in 20 days in China.\"\n\nWang was also confused by a recent street encounter. Two days before the new year, on her way to the supermarket, a stranger yelled at her to \"go back to China,\" and blamed her for stealing jobs in the US. \"I don't understand why he thought I stole his job,\" said Wang. \"We are here to create jobs.\"\n\nThis kind of hostility isn't exactly rare. A Pew Research Center survey from May found that eight in 10 Americans have negative views about China, and a study by researchers from Boston College, the University of Michigan, and Microsoft found that Asian restaurants in the US lost $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020 because of anti-Chinese sentiment, which President Donald Trump helped stoke by calling COVID-19 the \"China virus.\"\n\n\"Trump likes to stir racial antagonism,\" Chao Wang of Hunan Slurp said. The window of a noodle shop Wang owned in Long Island City, New York, was smashed during the pandemic, and he attributed it to anti-Asian hate.\n\nYong Zhao, the cofounder and chief executive of the American food chains Junzi Kitchen and Nice Day, had a disturbing moment a few months ago with a customer at his store in Long Island. \"I told him we are going to bring organic mushrooms from a local farm into our recipes, and he said, 'Oh, is the farm owned by the CCP?'\" said Zhao. The customer was referring to the rising concern that the Chinese Communist Party is spying on the US from farmlands purchased by Chinese entities. \"If I were white, I don't think he'd have asked.\"\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBefore the pandemic, Zhao, a Yale-educated environmental scientist turned restaurateur, had formed a network of young Chinese restaurant operators in the US with a mission to \"tell the stories of Chinese cuisine.\" But he said since the trade war began in 2018, American media has much less coverage of Chinese culture and lifestyle, and Americans seem less interested in Chinese culture. \"Say, you want to highlight the history of a traditional dish from Chengdu, but many people here don't know where Chengdu is,\" said Zhao, referring to the southwestern Chinese city that is known for mapo tofu and kung pao chicken.\n\nTo some industry people I spoke with, Chinese food companies are less likely to be caught up in geopolitical wrangling than, say, the tech industry, but their biggest risk factor may be their own growth. \"This is an industry that is safe until Chinese companies start to win, and then they're not safe,\" said Chris Pereira, the founder and CEO of iMpact, a New York-based consulting firm that has helped hundreds of Chinese enterprises enter the US.\n\nBefore he founded iMpact in 2020, Pereira worked as an executive at Huawei, the Chinese tech conglomerate that was driven out of the US market over national security concerns. Having watched that play out, Pereira suggests big Chinese food chains find ways to share profits with American partners as a form of self-protection. For instance, he said, if Luckin Coffee, the Chinese coffeehouse behemoth with more than 22,000 locations in China that plans to come to the US this year, starts to steal market share from Starbucks, \"you can bet the US government will find a way to talk about national security for coffee.\"\n\nIn a crowded back office at Quanjude's Manhattan site, Zhang has a more urgent challenge. The visa applications for the five chefs he plans to bring in from China are still pending. Since US-China relations started deteriorating, it's been harder to obtain visas for Chinese nationals, but Zhang says the Chinese-trained chefs are essential for the restaurant. \"We won't allow the quality of the food to suffer under untrained hands,\" he said. If nothing else works out, he plans to bring Quanjude chefs from Canada.\n\nZhang thinks his ducks could serve an important mission. \"I believe food is the best bridge for divisions and it may help pull the US and China closer again,\" he said.\n\nAfter a pause, he continued. \"Except if there is a hot war,\" he said, \"everything Chinese in the US would be doomed.\"\n\nRong Xiaoqing is a New York-based award-winning journalist who has been writing about the Chinese community in the US since 2002."

The National Hazards Partnership has issued an amber wildfire warning this weekend, highlighting the likelihood of fires that could be difficult to control. Ground conditions are already very dry, with no rain recorded so far in April for most areas.

Ground conditions are already very dry, with no rain recorded so far in April for most areas. This follows a record-dry March, which saw just 27.0mm of rainfall – 31% of the monthly average.\n\nDry weather and low humidity\n\nBBC WeatherWatcher Lawrence Dry and sunny weather - like this at Castlerock on the north coast earlier this week - can make it easier for fire to spread\n\nEasterly winds will continue to dry out vegetation and temperatures are expected to climb towards the low 20C next week. The amber warning also covers parts of England, Wales, and southern Scotland, reflecting growing concern as the dry spell continues with no significant rainfall in sight. In the Republic of Ireland, a Condition Orange fire warning – also the second-highest level – has been issued. The Irish government's notice warns of \"a high fire risk in all areas where hazardous fuels such as dead grasses and shrub fuels like heather and gorse exist\". It also highlights how fire behaviour can be intensified by low humidity, gusty winds, and recent fires linked to turf cutting and illegal dumping. The weekend will remain dry and sunny, with high pressure continuing to dominate the forecast at least through the middle of next week.\n\n'Don't be complacent'\n\nClaire Paine Seven appliances and 60 firefighters were sent to a fire on the Mourne Mountains in March, which was believed to have been started deliberately\n\nSome wildfires reported in the Mourne Mountains in recent weeks are thought to have been started deliberately. Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir described the blazes as having a devastating impact on the environment and wildlife. \"No one should start a fire in the countryside unless it's part of a specific planned and properly managed land management practice. \"People lighting these fires may be putting their own and others' lives at risk including the fire service personnel and other emergency services tasked to deal with them,\" he said. Five wildfires have already been reported in the Mourne Mountains in recent weeks. NI Water is warning of the long-lasting impact fires can have on both the environment and drinking water supplies. \"Wildfires don't just damage wildlife and habitats,\" said Becca Allen, Catchment Officer at NI Water. \"When a wildfire happens it also removes the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil to make its way into reservoirs which provide our drinking water. \"This requires a lot of resources to remove at the water treatment stage. We all have our part to play in protecting the environment and enjoy our time in the countryside responsibly\". The utility company is reminding the public that water catchment areas must be protected — particularly during prolonged dry spells.\n\nPublic safety advice\n\nGetty Images A helicopter over Slieve Donard Mountain in April 2021 in Newcastle, County Down\n\nIn line with guidance from the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC), authorities are issuing clear guidance: Never light fires or barbecues in open countryside\n\nFully extinguish cigarettes and never discard them outdoors\n\nReport fires or suspicious activity immediately by dialling 999\n\nTake rubbish home to avoid accidental ignition\n\nAvoid using disposable barbecues, especially in high-risk areas Jon Charters, Wildfire Lead at the NFCC, said the public plays a key role in prevention. \"With the current conditions, we are urging the public to take extra precautions to reduce the risk of fires starting. \"Many of these incidents are preventable, and we need everyone to play their part in keeping our countryside and open spaces safe.\"\n\nPolice urge caution in the Mournes"

If a rainstorm floods a subway tunnel or a fire consumes a residential neighborhood, a real-time documentary is not far behind.\n\nOn Friday at midday local time, a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar. Thousands are feared dead. Even in one of the poorest countries in the world, footage of the event itself was immediately available: monks cowering as a building collapsed down the block, a stupa tipping off a temple building in a shower of red dirt. Hundreds of miles away in Bangkok, a construction worker filmed his colleagues running from a half-finished skyscraper as it collapsed into a cloud of dust.\n\nI’m mesmerized by a relatively new entrant into this genre: The sight of rooftop pools sloshing over their parapets, raining water onto the streets below. A handful of skyscrapers in Bangkok spilled over on Friday. Like a lamp swinging from the ceiling, these high-rise waterfalls are a testament to the seismically generated building movement that can be hard to see with the naked eye. Water suddenly appears in places there is not supposed to be water. It’s like seeing a building cry.\n\nMoment of the 7.7 Magnitude powerful earthquake in Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭 (28.03.2025) pic.twitter.com/KOLTBVS4ES — Disaster News (@Top_Disaster) March 28, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPov: the situation on top of the tallest building near the swimming pool during the earthquake in Myanmar and Thailand pic.twitter.com/njNC7QTSfL — Glo Hermawan (@gloriahermawan) March 28, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you really want a lesson in fluid dynamics, you can watch the videos of the pools themselves.\n\nIt’s unsettling to see a tall building spill its drink like a drunk at a party. But ultimately, it’s proof of structural achievement: The buildings rock enough to send hundreds of gallons of water overboard, but in spite of their height, they are strong enough to resist the tremors. (It is the age of a building, not its height, that generally puts occupants at risk during an earthquake.)\n\nWhile this phenomenon is not brand new—quake-driven rooftop pool waterfalls have been caught on camera in Manila, Puerto Vallarta, and Taipei in recent years—it’s increasingly frequent. And not just because more people are pointing their phones at the sky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting a pool at the top of a building is a relatively recent development in the history of high-rise construction. Water is heavy (don’t fill up an inflatable pool on your roof), and when pools aren’t well-built, the damage can be enormous. There’s a reason landlords don’t want tenants to have fish tanks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a report on high-rise pools from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Chicago’s John Hancock Center was the first super-tall building to offer a swim with a view when its 44th-floor pool opened in 1969. But as recently as 2000, most of the world’s super-tall buildings (over 900 feet) did not include pools. That has changed: Since the millennium, most of them do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate A Nation of First Responders Read More\n\nSome of that reflects the engineering innovations that have allowed giant buildings to proliferate in recent decades. But it’s also a testament to the changing geography of global growth, as skyscraper construction has shifted from North America and Europe to the Gulf and East Asia. Two-thirds of the world’s super-tall buildings have been built in China and the UAE alone, and rooftop pools are obviously a more desirable amenity in warm-weather locales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the skyscrapers with rooftop pools—often flanked by cocktail bars, dance floors, or expensive restaurants—are a societal status symbol. The most famous visual landmark associated with Singapore is probably the Marina Bay Sands, with Moshe Safdie’s oblong, swimmable rooftop straddling three buildings.\n\nMost rooftop pools aren’t so easy to spot from below. And that’s part of what makes the videos from Bangkok so revelatory. Disasters pretend to be egalitarian. Ultimately, though, they expose the fissures in society, revealing the disparate experiences between those who have a well-built home, an insurance policy, or somewhere else to go—and those who do not. When water tumbles from a roof, it reveals the power of the earthquake, but also the hidden inequality of the city, provoking the sudden realization, from a lower floor or a hot street below, that those people up there can go for a swim.\n\nMeanwhile, in Myanmar, first responders are trying to find people trapped in the wreckage of collapsed structures. The grim reason it takes a long time to confirm an earthquake’s death toll is that many people, if not most, survive the initial collapse. What determines their fate is how quickly someone comes to look for them."

Per an update shared by the Myanmar authorities on Saturday, the death toll has risen above 1,600. In addition, authorities report over 3,000 people are injured, with over 100 others missing. Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, is among the hardest-hit areas, with widespread destruction. Meanwhile, in Thailand, a total of 18 people have been reported killed by the earthquake so far. 11 of those were at the site of the collapse of a high-rise building under construction. Dozens of people are said to be unaccounted for.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn Sunday, March 30, a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck near Mandalay, prompting alarm before rescue efforts continued. Read More: Photos Show Devastating Impact of Powerful Earthquake That Rocked Myanmar and Thailand Myanmar’s ruling military junta declared a state of emergency in several regions affected by the earthquake on Friday, and called for humanitarian aid in a rare show of international appeal. Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said in a statement that the earthquake “could not come at a worse time” for Myanmar, as it still reels from the 2021 military coup and subsequent displacement of masses in a civil war. “All parties to the armed conflict should be prioritizing the needs of civilians whose lives have been upended in this disaster and ensuring that they have unfettered access to aid,” Freeman said. “Human rights must be at the centre of all relief efforts, and there must be no discrimination in aid provision.”\n\nUNICEF, originally the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, has also addressed Myanmar’s precarious situation. A statement on the UNICEF USA website has called for “all parties to uphold the rights of children and ensure unhindered humanitarian access.” As the affected areas continue to recover—a process that has only just begun—countries around the globe have come out to send humanitarian aid. Here are the ways that you can help victims of the Myanmar earthquake. U.N. Crisis Relief The United Nations is calling for donations in addition to an initial allocation of $5 million from the U.N. Emergency Fund by Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher. Donations will go directly to the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund, and will “provide them with urgently needed food, water, shelter and other basic support at this critical time.” Red Cross The “Red Cross Red Crescent is working to deliver emergency relief and to get help to those impacted by the earthquake as quickly as possible.” Teams from the Myanmar Red Cross Society are also working to connect hospitals and clinics with emergency blood donations.\n\nUNICEF USA\n\nUNICEF runs disaster relief operations focused on children’s needs and has asked for donations specifically for children impacted and displaced by the earthquake. “UNICEF is on the ground in Myanmar, working with partners to meet children's needs. The earthquake is the latest blow to a country already struggling with escalating conflict and climate shocks,” the agency’s website reads.\n\nSave the Children\n\nSave the Children is an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) that works specifically to protect children at risk. They have launched a “Children’s Emergency Fund” for youths in Myanmar in need of shelter and other basic needs in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nProject HOPE\n\nProject HOPE is working to “address both urgent and long-term needs, including primary and mental health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene,” for those affected by the earthquake. The nonprofit organization has previously responded to other natural disasters by deploying humanitarian aid to places such as Morocco, Syria, Turkey, and Haiti."

        "content": "Here's what to do if you're caught driving in high winds, tornadoes or dust storms\n\ntoggle caption Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWindy weather can kick up at a moment's notice — and if you're behind the wheel, you may have little time to react.\n\nStrong winds can jostle your vehicle and others on the road, topple power lines and litter the ground with debris. Other powerful, windy weather phenomena, such as dust storms or tornadoes, present their own problems, too. Last month, dust storms in Texas and Kansas reduced visibility on roads, resulting in multi-car pileups that killed at least 11 people.\n\nThis week, \"a potent spring storm\" is forecast to sweep through parts of the Plains, Midwest and South, according to the National Weather Service, bringing the likelihood of powerful, even life-threatening winds.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Wind is unlike many other hazards because you really can't see it,\" says Bill Van Tassel, who manages AAA's driver training programs.\n\nHere are some expert tips for drivers on staying safe when it's windy out — and what to do if you're caught in dangerous conditions.\n\n\n\nCheck the forecast before you go\n\nOne way to avoid driving in potentially dangerous winds is to stay off the road in the first place. Check the weather forecast before you leave and, if possible, delay or cancel your travel plans if treacherous conditions are predicted.\n\n\"Driving safely in windy conditions begins with not driving in windy conditions,\" Van Tassel says.\n\ntoggle caption AP/Kansas Highway Patrol\n\nThe National Weather Service issues high wind warnings when it expects sustained winds to reach at least 40 miles an hour and gusts to reach at least 58 miles per hour. The service also publishes tornado watches and warnings, plus advisories and warnings for blowing dust that can diminish visibility.\n\n\n\nKeep your vehicle under control\n\nIf you do get caught out in windy weather, it's important to slow down, keep both hands on the wheel and give yourself some space to maneuver if you have to act quickly.\n\n\"You might have to steer suddenly toward the wind just to keep your car going straight,\" Van Tassel says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBe aware of the other vehicles on the road that are in front of, behind and next to you. They could get knocked in your direction by a strong gust. In particular, keep an eye out for larger vehicles, which are more likely to be pushed around or even toppled by heavy winds.\n\n\n\nPull over if you need to, but be careful\n\nIf you see other cars getting blown around by severe wind, you might want to pull over onto the shoulder and wait for the weather to pass, Van Tassel says. You can activate your hazard lights to let other motorists know you're there.\n\nIn a dust storm, pull over and even leave the roadway if you can, but turn all your lights off and take your foot off the brake. According to the NWS, crashes sometimes occur during dust storms when drivers use other cars' lights to steer themselves toward safety.\n\n\"Vehicles approaching from the rear and using the advance car's lights as a guide have inadvertently left the roadway and in some instances collided with the parked vehicle,\" according to the service.\n\nThe NWS also says that drivers should not park under trees or other objects that could fall on their vehicle, and should never stop in the roadway itself.\n\n\n\nLook out for debris and tornadoes\n\nHigh winds can bring down trees, knock over power lines and send other material tumbling into the roadway, creating hazards for drivers. In more extreme cases, tornadoes can launch debris through the air.\n\nReady.gov, an emergency preparedness website from the federal government, says you can try to move out of the path of a distant tornado by driving away from it at right angles.\n\nBut if you encounter a twister while driving and can't make it to a tornado shelter, Van Tassel says the best strategy is to get out of your vehicle and get into a low position in an area below ground level, such as a ditch or a ravine.\n\n\"Staying in your vehicle might sound good on the face of it,\" Van Tassel says. But \"rollover-type crashes are very deadly, and being picked up by a tornado [in] your vehicle would be like being in the worst rollover crash imaginable.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt's not a good idea to stop under a bridge or an overpass, either. The NWS says blocking traffic could lead to accidents, and you won't be protected from flying debris or the potential collapse of the bridge itself.\n\nAnd if you come across a downed power line, make sure to not drive over or touch it."

        "content": "BANGKOK — A powerful earthquake rocked Myanmar on Friday, causing extensive damage across a wide swath of one of the world’s poorest countries and prompting officials to warn that the initial death toll — above 140 — was likely to grow in the days ahead. In neighboring Thailand, at least six died in Bangkok, where a high-rise under construction collapsed. The full extent of death, injury and destruction was not immediately clear — particularly in Myanmar, which is embroiled in a civil war, and where information is tightly controlled.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,” the head of Myanmar’s military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said as he announced on television that at least 144 people were killed and 730 others were injured in his country. Read More: Photos Show Devastating Impact of Powerful Earthquake That Rocked Myanmar and Thailand In Thailand, authorities in Bangkok said six people were killed, 22 were injured and 101 were missing from three construction sites, including the high-rise. They revised the death toll Saturday morning from 10 reported the previous day, saying several critically injured people were mistakenly reported dead. Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said that more people were believed to be alive in the wreckage as search efforts continued Saturday morning. The 7.7 magnitude quake struck at midday, with an epicenter near Mandalay, Myanmar ’s second-largest city. Aftershocks followed, one of them measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude.\n\nMyanmar is in an active earthquake belt, though many of the temblors happen in sparsely populated areas, not cities like those affected Friday. The U.S. Geological Survey, an American government science agency, estimated that the death toll could top 1,000. In Mandalay, the earthquake reportedly brought down multiple buildings, including one of the city’s largest monasteries. Photos from the capital city of Naypyidaw showed rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of multiple buildings used to house civil servants. Rescue teams head to Myanmar Myanmar's government said blood was in high demand in the hardest-hit areas. In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar was ready to accept assistance. A 37-member team from the Chinese province of Yunnan reached the city of Yangon early Saturday with earthquake detectors, drones and other supplies, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nRussia’s emergencies ministry dispatched two planes carrying 120 rescuers and supplies, according to a report from the Russian state news agency Tass. India sent a search and rescue team and a medical team as well as blankets, tarpaulin, hygiene kits, sleeping bags, solar lamps, food packets and kitchen sets, the country’s foreign minister posted on X. Malaysia's foreign ministry said the country will send 50 people on Sunday to help identify and provide aid to the worst-hit areas. The United Nations allocated $5 million to start relief efforts. President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. was going to help with the response, but some experts were concerned about this effort given his administration’s deep cuts in foreign assistance. But amid images of buckled and cracked roads and reports of a collapsed bridge and a burst dam, there were concerns about how rescuers would even reach some areas in a country already enduring a humanitarian crisis.\n\n“We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,\" said Mohammed Riyas, the International Rescue Committee’s Myanmar director. Bridge and monastery collapse and dam bursts in Myanmar Myanmar's English-language state newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar, said five cities and towns had seen building collapses and two bridges had fallen, including one on a key highway between Mandalay and Yangon. A photo on the newspaper’s website showed wreckage of a sign that read “EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT,\" which the caption said was part of the capital’s main 1,000-bed hospital. Elsewhere, video posted online showed robed monks in a Mandalay street, shooting their own video of the multistory Ma Soe Yane monastery before it suddenly fell into the ground. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was harmed. Video also showed damage to the former royal palace.\n\nChristian Aid said its partners and colleagues on the ground reported that a dam burst in the city, causing water levels to rise in the lowland areas. Residents of Yangon, the nation's largest city, rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. In Naypyitaw, some homes stood partly crumbled, while rescuers heaved away bricks from the piles of debris. An injured man reclined on a wheeled stretcher, while another man fanned him in the heat. In a country where many people already were struggling, “this disaster will have left people devastated,” said Julie Mehigan, who oversees Christian Aid’s work in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. “Even before this heartbreaking earthquake, we know conflict and displacement has left countless people in real need,” Mehigan said. Myanmar's military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and is now involved in a bloody civil war with long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy ones.\n\nGovernment forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations. Bangkok building collapsed in a cloud of dust In Thailand, a 33-story building under construction crumpled into a cloud of dust near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak market, and onlookers could be seen screaming and running in a video posted on social media. Vehicles on a nearby freeway came to a stop. Sirens blared across the Thai capital's downtown as a rescuers streamed to the wreckage. Above them, shredded steel and broken concrete blocks, some stacked like pancakes, rose in a towering heap. Injured people were rushed away on gurneys, and hospital beds were also wheeled outside onto a sidewalk. “It’s a great tragedy,\" Deputy Prime Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit said after viewing the site.\n\nEarthquakes are rarely felt in the Bangkok metropolitan area, home to more than 17 million people, many of whom live in high-rise apartments. Voranoot Thirawat, a lawyer working in central Bangkok, said she first realized something was wrong when she saw a light swinging back and forth. Then she heard the building creaking, and she and her colleagues fled down 12 flights of stairs. “In my lifetime, there was no earthquake like this in Bangkok,” she said. Fraser Morton, a tourist from Scotland, was in one of Bangkok’s many malls when the quake struck. “All of a sudden, the whole building began to move. Immediately, there was screaming and a lot of panic,” he said. Some people fled down upward-moving escalators, he said. Nearby, Paul Vincent, a tourist visiting from England, recalled seeing a high-rise building swaying, water falling from a rooftop pool and people crying in the streets. The U.S. Geological Survey and Germany’s GFZ center for geosciences said the earthquake was a shallow 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), according to preliminary reports. Shallower earthquakes tend to cause more damage.\n\nInjuries reported in China\n\nTo the northeast, the earthquake was felt in China's Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused damage and injuries in the city of Ruili on the border with Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nThe shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet.\n\n—Adam Schreck, Haruka Naga, Jerry Harmer, Grant Peck and Penny Wang in Bangkok, Jamey Keaten in Geneva, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Edith M.

At least 144 people have died and 732 have been injured so far in the country, Myanmar military leader Min Aung Hlaing said. The epicentre was 16km (10 miles) north-west of the city of Sagaing, sending strong tremors that were felt as far as south-west China and Thailand. Meanwhile, around 100 construction workers are missing after an unfinished high-rise building collapsed hundreds of miles away in Bangkok, according to Thailand's deputy prime minister.\n\nAt least seven people have died at the site in Thailand, according to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. A rescuer in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, told the BBC the damage is \"enormous\". The total number of people killed and injured by the earthquake are expected to rise in the coming days. There have been reports of roads buckling in the capital of Nay Pyi Taw, and the country's military government has declared a state of emergency in six regions. The earthquake struck near Mandalay, which has a population of about 1.5 million people. A second quake struck 12 minutes after the first, according to the USGS, with a magnitude of 6.4 and its epicentre was 18km (11.1 miles) south of Sagaing. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, gained independence from Britain in 1948, but its recent history has been marked by unrest and conflict. The military seized power in 2021, ten years after agreeing to hand over control to a civilian government. Since then, the junta has cracked down hard on dissent, executing democracy activists and jailing journalists. The state controls almost all local radio, television, print and online media, and Internet use is restricted in the country, which often makes access to information difficult. According to a recent BBC data project, the country is now controlled by a patchwork of groups, making relief and recovery efforts more challenging. It is even harder to find accurate information about what is going on in rebel-held areas of the country. The junta made a rare call for international assistance in the wake of the earthquake.\n\nHowever, the complex situation on the ground is likely to hamper search and rescue operations as well as the free flow of aid into the country. Rescue workers operating in villages near Mandalay have told the BBC they do not have access to the heavy machinery needed to reach people trapped under the rubble. \"We're digging people out with our bare hands,\" one man said. The earthquake has added pressure to an already dire humanitarian situation in the country, where 3.5m people are estimated to have been displaced by fighting. The Sagaing region, near the epicentre of the quake, is a volatile key battleground in the civil war. Charities and opposition parties working in the country have raised concerns about the \"politicisation\" of aid in the coming days. Montse Ferrer, the deputy director of East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific at Amnesty International, told the BBC the junta has \"a history of denying aid\" to areas where resistance forces are active. Watch: Moment Bangkok high-rise under construction collapses\n\nEyewitnesses describe horror in quake's aftermath\n\nIn pictures: Damaged buildings and buckled roads The tremors were felt hundreds of miles away in Thailand's capital of Bangkok, where rescue teams worked through the night to free the construction workers trapped beneath the rubble. Buildings across the city were evacuated, including a hospital holding patients in acute need of medical attention. A woman gave birth on the street amid the commotion, lying on a stretcher surrounded by hospital staff. Bui Thu, a BBC journalist who lives in Bangkok, told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme that she was at home cooking when the initial quake happened. \"I was very nervous, I was very panicked,\" she said. \"Buildings in Bangkok are not engineered for earthquakes, so I think that's why I think there's going to be big damage.\" Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra visited the site of the collapsed building on Friday afternoon. Search and rescue teams using drones, sniffer dogs and diggers have been mobilised and disaster centres set up to help with the rescue operation. Additional reporting by BBC Burmese"

        "content": "As fires burned in Los Angeles this year, newer toxin monitors found contaminants that aren’t measured by standard methods. Now scientists and officials are pushing for better detection\n\nWhen the catastrophic Los Angeles fires broke out in January of 2025, John Volckens suspected firefighters and residents were breathing toxic air from the burning homes, buildings, and cars, but it was unclear how much risk the public faced. So, the professor of environmental health at Colorado State University devised a plan to get answers.\n\nVolckens shipped 10 air pollution detectors to Los Angeles to measure the amounts of heavy metals, benzene, and other chemicals released by the flames, which burned more than 16,000 homes, businesses, and other structures, making it one of the country’s costliest natural disasters.\n\n“These disaster events keep happening. They release pollution into the environment and to the surrounding community,” said Volckens, who shared his results with local air regulators. “We have this kind of traumatic experience, and then we’re left with: Well, what did we just breathe in?”\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nScientists and public health officials have long tracked the pollutants that cause smog, acid rain, and other environmental health hazards and shared them with the public through the local Air Quality Index. But the monitoring system misses hundreds of harmful chemicals released in urban fires, and the Los Angeles fires have led to a renewed push for state and federal regulators to do more as climate change drives up the frequency of these natural disasters.\n\nIt’s questionable whether the Trump administration will act, however. Earlier this month, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced what he described as the “biggest deregulatory” action in history, which critics warn will lead to a rollback of environmental health regulations.\n\nWhile Air Quality Index values are a good starting place for knowing what’s in the air, they don’t provide a full picture of pollutants, especially during disasters, said Yifang Zhu, a professor of environmental health sciences at UCLA. In fact, the AQI could be in a healthy range, “but you could still be exposed to higher air toxins from the fires,” she added.\n\nHeavy smoke from the Eaton fire in Los Angeles. Josh EdelsonAFP via Getty Images\n\nIn February, nearly a dozen lawmakers from California called on the EPA to create a task force of local and federal authorities to better monitor what’s in the air and inform the public. Locals are “unsure of the actual risks they face and confused by conflicting reports about how safe it is to breathe the air outside, which may lead to families not taking adequate protective measures,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to James Payne, who was then the acting EPA administrator. The EPA press office declined to comment in an e-mail to KFF Health News.\n\nLawmakers have also introduced bills in Congress and in the California legislature to address the gap. A measure by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) would direct the EPA to allocate grant money to local air pollution agencies to communicate the risks of wildfire smoke, including deploying air monitors. Meanwhile, a bill by Democratic state Assembly member Lisa Calderon would create a “Wildfire Smoke Research and Education Fund” to study the health impacts of wildfire smoke, especially on firefighters and residents affected by fires.\n\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District, a regional air pollution control agency, operates about 35 air monitoring stations across nearly 11,000 square miles of the Los Angeles region to measure pollutants like ozone and carbon monoxide.\n\nDuring the fires, the agency, which is responsible for the air quality of 16.8 million residents, relied on its network of stations to monitor five common pollutants, including PM2.5, the fine particles that make up smoke and can travel deep inside the body. After the fires, the South Coast AQMD deployed two mobile monitoring vans to assess air quality in cleanup areas and expanded neighborhood-level monitoring during debris removal, said Jason Low, head of the agency’s monitoring and analysis division.\n\nLocal officials also received the data collected by Volcken’s devices, which arrived on-site four days after the fires broke out. The monitors — about the size of a television remote control and housed in a plastic cover the size of a bread loaf — were placed at air monitoring stations around the fires’ perimeters, as well as at other sites, including in West Los Angeles and Santa Clarita. The devices, called AirPens, monitored dozens of air contaminants in real time and collected precise chemical measurements of smoke composition.\n\nResearchers replaced the sensors every week, sending the filters to a lab that analyzed them for measurements of volatile organic compounds like benzene, lead, and black carbon, along with other carcinogens. Volcken’s devices provided public health officials with data for a month as cleanup started. The hope is that the information provided can help guide future health policies in fire-prone areas.\n\n“There’s not one device that can measure everything in real time,” Low said. “So, we have to rely on different tools for each different type of purpose of monitoring.”\n\nASCENT, a national monitoring network funded by the National Science Foundation, registered big changes after the fires. One monitor, about 11 miles south of the Eaton fire in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, detected 40 times the normal amount of chlorine in the air and 110 times the typical amount of lead in the days following the fires. It was clear the chemical spikes came from urban wildfire smoke, which is more dangerous than what would be emitted when trees and bushes burn in rural areas, said Richard Flagan, the co-principal investigator at the network’s site in Los Angeles.\n\n“Ultimately, the purpose is to get the data out there in real time, both for the public to see but also for people who are doing other aspects of research,” said Flagan, adding that chemical measurements are critical for epidemiologists who are developing health statistics or doing long-term studies of the impact of air pollution on peoples’ health.\n\nSmall, low-cost sensors could fill in gaps as government networks age or fail to adequately capture the full picture of what’s in the air. Such sensors can identify pollution hot spots and improve wildfire smoke warnings, according to a March 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office report.\n\nAlthough the devices have become smaller and more accurate in the past decade, some pollutants require analysis with X-ray scans and other costly high-level equipment, said J. Alfredo Gómez, director of the Natural Resources and Environment team at the GAO. And Gómez cautioned that the quality of the data can vary depending on what the devices monitor.\n\n“Low-cost sensors do a good job of measuring PM2.5 but not such a good job for some of these other air toxins, where they still need to do more work,” Gómez said.\n\nUCLA’s Zhu said the emerging technology of portable pollution monitors means residents — not just government and scientists — might be able to install equipment in their backyards and broaden the picture of what’s happening in the air at the most local level.\n\n“If the fires are predicted to be worse in the future, it might be a worthwhile investment to have some ability to capture specific types of pollutants that are not routinely measured by government stations,” Zhu said.\n\nKFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism."
